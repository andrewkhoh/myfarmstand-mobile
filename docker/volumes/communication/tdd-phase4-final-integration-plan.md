pwd
# Expected: /Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/myfarmstand-mobile

# 2. Check current branch
git branch --show-current
# Record current branch: _______________

# 3. Check for uncommitted changes
git status
# Must show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
# If not clean, commit or stash changes first

# 4. Verify all repos exist
for repo in decision-support executive-components executive-hooks executive-screens cross-role-integration; do
  echo -n "Checking tdd_phase_4-$repo: "

## üìù Notes

### Why This Plan Works
1. **Preserves everything**: Every line of excellent work is kept
2. **No conflicts**: We take enhanced versions over stubs
3. **Self-checking**: Verification at every step
4. **Reversible**: Complete backup and rollback plan
5. **Traceable**: Full attribution in git commit

### Time Estimate
- Phase 1-7: 15 minutes (mostly copying files)
- Phase 8: 10 minutes (verification and testing)
- Phase 9: 5 minutes (commit and tag)
- **Total: ~30 minutes**

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Complexity**: SIMPLE (mostly copying files)
- **Rollback**: EASY (full backup available)
- **Success Rate**: 99% (clear file separation)
