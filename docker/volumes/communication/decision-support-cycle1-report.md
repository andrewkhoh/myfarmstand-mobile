## Key Architectural Patterns Implemented

### 1. Confidence Scoring System
```typescript
Every recommendation includes:
- confidence: 0-1 score based on data quality
- impact.confidence: Specific confidence for impact assessment
- Historical accuracy weighting
```

### 2. Priority Ranking Algorithm
```typescript
Priority = f(impact * confidence * urgency)
- High: Score > 0.75
- Medium: Score 0.4-0.75  
- Low: Score < 0.4
```

### 3. Action Recommendations
```typescript
Each recommendation includes:
- Specific action type
- Detailed parameters
- Implementation steps
- Timeline estimates
```
