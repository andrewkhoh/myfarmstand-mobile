## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Recommendation Engine** (`src/features/decision-support/services/recommendationEngine.ts`)
   - Confidence scoring for all recommendations
   - Impact assessment with revenue/cost projections
   - Priority ranking based on business impact
   - Support for multiple data sources (inventory, marketing, operations, financial, customer)

2. **Test Data Generators** (`src/features/decision-support/utils/testDataGenerators.ts`)
   - Comprehensive mock data generation for all executive data types
   - Configurable parameters for testing various scenarios

3. **Type Definitions** (`src/features/decision-support/types/index.ts`)
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all decision support entities
   - Strong typing for recommendations, impacts, and business data

### Key Capabilities
- **Inventory Analysis**: Stockout risk, overstock detection, turnover optimization
- **Marketing Analysis**: Campaign ROI, channel optimization, budget reallocation
- **Operations Analysis**: Bottleneck detection, efficiency improvements
- **Financial Analysis**: Cash flow issues, working capital optimization
- **Customer Analysis**: Churn risk, segment optimization

### Architectural Patterns Followed
- ✅ Single validation pass with Zod schemas
- ✅ User-isolated cache keys with React Query
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Graceful degradation for incomplete data
- ✅ Individual item processing with skip-on-error

## Next Steps for Subsequent Cycles

### Recommended Enhancements (Cycles 2-5)
1. **Cycle 2**: Add real-time data integration
2. **Cycle 3**: Implement machine learning models for predictions
3. **Cycle 4**: Add historical tracking and learning
4. **Cycle 5**: Polish UI components and visualization

### Ready for Next Agent
The decision support foundation is complete and ready for:
- `executive-components` to build UI components
- `executive-hooks` to create React hooks
- `executive-screens` to implement full screens
- `cross-role-integration` for final integration

## Technical Details

### Test Command
```bash
npm run test:decision -- --coverage
```
