# Phase 1 Integration Complete - With Critical Issues

## Status: ❌ FAILED - REQUIRES FIXES

### Test Results:
- Services: 82% (BELOW 85% target)
- Hooks: 100% (EXCEEDS target)
- Components: 0% (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Critical Blockers:
1. Executive service tests - ALL have syntax errors
2. Marketing service tests - 13 assertion failures
3. Role service tests - Parse errors
4. Missing EXPO_PUBLIC_CHANNEL_SECRET environment variable
5. No component tests implemented

### Pattern Violations:
- Mixed mock patterns (SimplifiedSupabaseMock + manual)
- Syntax errors showing lack of testing
- Missing validation pipelines

### Next Steps Required:
1. Fix ALL syntax/parse errors
2. Achieve ≥85% service pass rate
3. Implement component tests
4. Follow architectural patterns correctly

**Phase 1 cannot proceed until these issues are resolved.**
