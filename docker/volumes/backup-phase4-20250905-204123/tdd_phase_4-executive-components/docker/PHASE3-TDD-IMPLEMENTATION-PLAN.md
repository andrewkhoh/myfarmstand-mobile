# Phase 3 Marketing Operations - TDD Implementation Plan

## üî¥ TDD Philosophy: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR ‚Üí AUDIT

Following the strict TDD approach where we:
1. **Write tests FIRST** (RED phase - tests fail)
2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
3. **Optimize and refactor** (REFACTOR phase)
4. **Validate compliance** (AUDIT phase)

## üìä Current TDD Status Analysis

### What's Actually Implemented (But May Have Failing Tests)

Based on the gap analysis, we have:
- ‚úÖ Schema files exist (but tests may be failing)
- ‚úÖ Service files exist (but have import errors)
- ‚úÖ Basic hooks exist (but missing specialized ones)
- ‚ùå NO screens (0% - all tests would fail)
- ‚ùå NO components (0% - all tests would fail)
- ‚ùå NO integration tests (0% - all would fail)

### TDD Implementation Status

| Component | Tests Written | Tests Passing | TDD Status |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Schemas | ~30/37 | Unknown | Partial RED |
| Services | ~40/47 | 0% (import errors) | RED |
| Hooks | ~20/60 | Unknown | Partial RED |
| Screens | 0/80 | 0% | Not Started |
| Components | 0/40 | 0% | Not Started |
| Integration | 0/45 | 0% | Not Started |

- Verify all tests follow patterns
- Ensure proper mocking setup
- Confirm all tests are failing

### Week 2: GREEN Phase (Make Tests Pass)

- Implement missing hooks (40+ tests to pass)
- Implement all components (45+ tests to pass)

**Day 6-7: Screen Implementation**
- Implement all screens (120+ tests to pass)
- Integrate with hooks and components

**Day 8: Integration Implementation**
- Implement workflow state machine
- Fix all integration tests (55+ tests to pass)

### Week 3: REFACTOR & AUDIT Phase
**Day 9-10: Refactoring**
- Performance optimization
- Code cleanup
- Pattern compliance

**Day 11: Audit & Compliance**
- Run full compliance audit
- Fix any violations
- Final validation

## üéØ TDD Success Metrics

### RED Phase Success Criteria
- [ ] 269+ tests written
- [ ] 100% tests failing
- [ ] All tests follow established patterns
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes

### GREEN Phase Success Criteria
- [ ] All 269+ tests passing
- [ ] No skipped tests
- [ ] >90% code coverage
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

### REFACTOR Phase Success Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Code quality metrics pass
- [ ] Pattern compliance 100%

### AUDIT Phase Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero pattern violations
- [ ] All architectural guidelines followed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for production

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create test infrastructure configs**
   ```bash
   - jest.config.hooks.marketing.js
   - jest.config.screens.marketing.js
   - jest.config.components.marketing.js
   ```

2. **Setup test data factories**
   ```typescript
   - src/test/factories/marketing/content.factory.ts
   - src/test/factories/marketing/campaign.factory.ts
   - src/test/factories/marketing/bundle.factory.ts
   ```

3. **Launch RED Phase agents**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-tdd.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Monitor test writing progress**
   ```bash
   watch "npm run test:marketing -- --listTests | wc -l"
   ```

## üìù TDD Commit Strategy

### Automated Commits on Test Status Change
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "tdd:red:commit": "npm test && exit 1 || git add -A && git commit -m 'test(marketing): RED phase - tests written and failing'",
    "tdd:green:commit": "npm test && git add -A && git commit -m 'feat(marketing): GREEN phase - tests passing'",
    "tdd:refactor:commit": "npm test && npm run lint && git add -A && git commit -m 'refactor(marketing): optimized implementation'",
    "tdd:audit:commit": "npm run validate:patterns && git add -A && git commit -m 'chore(marketing): audit complete - 100% compliance'"
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical TDD Rules

1. **NO implementation without failing tests**
2. **Write minimal code to pass tests**
3. **Refactor only after tests pass**
4. **Each agent commits when their phase completes**
5. **Pattern compliance is mandatory**

This TDD approach ensures we build exactly what's needed, with full test coverage from the start.
