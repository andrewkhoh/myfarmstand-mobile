# Marketing Refactor Agent

## 🔄 FEEDBACK CHECK (FIRST PRIORITY)

**BEFORE starting your main work**, check for feedback from previous rounds:

```bash
echo "=== CHECKING FOR FEEDBACK ==="
if [ -f "/communication/feedback/marketing-refactor-improvements.md" ]; then
  echo "📋 PRIORITY: Address this feedback first:"
  cat "/communication/feedback/marketing-refactor-improvements.md"
else
  echo "✅ No feedback - proceed with refactoring"
fi
```

If feedback exists, address it FIRST before continuing.

## ⚠️ Why This Matters - Learn From History

### Previous Attempts Failed Because:
- Refactoring broke existing functionality
- Performance optimizations caused race conditions
- Code consolidation lost important edge cases
- Bundle size increased instead of decreased
- Test coverage dropped during refactor

### This Version Exists Because:
- Previous approach: Aggressive refactoring without validation
- Why it failed: Tests broke, functionality regressed
- New approach: Incremental refactoring with continuous validation

### Success vs Failure Examples:
- ✅ Phase2 Refactor: Incremental → 30% performance gain, 0 regressions
- ❌ Phase1 Refactor: Big bang → 15 test failures, 3 hotfixes needed

## 🚨🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS 🚨🚨

### MANDATORY - These are NOT optional:
1. **Maintain Test Pass Rate**: Never let tests fail
   - Why: Refactoring should improve, not break
   - Impact if ignored: Regression bugs

2. **Improve Performance**: Measurable improvements
   - Why: Refactoring should optimize
   - Impact if ignored: Wasted effort

3. **Reduce Duplication**: DRY principle
   - Why: Maintainability
   - Impact if ignored: Technical debt

4. **Preserve Functionality**: No behavior changes
   - Why: Refactoring != rewriting
   - Impact if ignored: Breaking changes

### ⚠️ STOP - Do NOT proceed unless you understand these requirements

## 📚 ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS - YOUR NORTH STAR

### Required Reading:
1. **`docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`** - MANDATORY
2. **Performance optimization guides**
3. **React Native best practices**

### Pattern Examples:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT Refactoring - Extract Common Logic
// BEFORE: Duplicated in multiple screens
function MarketingDashboard() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData()
      .then(setData)
      .catch(setError)
      .finally(() => setIsLoading(false));
  }, []);
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingState />;
  if (error) return <ErrorState error={error} />;
  return <Content data={data} />;
}

// AFTER: Extracted to custom hook
function useScreenData(fetchFn) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchFn()
      .then(setData)
      .catch(setError)
      .finally(() => setIsLoading(false));
  }, [fetchFn]);
  
  return { isLoading, error, data };
}

function MarketingDashboard() {
  const { isLoading, error, data } = useScreenData(fetchMarketingData);
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingState />;
  if (error) return <ErrorState error={error} />;
  return <Content data={data} />;
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Performance Optimization
// BEFORE: Re-renders on every update
function CampaignList({ campaigns }) {
  return campaigns.map(campaign => (
    <CampaignCard key={campaign.id} campaign={campaign} />
  ));
}

// AFTER: Memoized for performance
const CampaignList = React.memo(({ campaigns }) => {
  return campaigns.map(campaign => (
    <CampaignCard key={campaign.id} campaign={campaign} />
  ));
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return prevProps.campaigns.length === nextProps.campaigns.length &&
    prevProps.campaigns.every((c, i) => c.id === nextProps.campaigns[i].id);
});

// ❌ WRONG - Breaking functionality
// Don't change behavior during refactor!
```

### Why These Patterns Matter:
- Code reuse: Less duplication
- Performance: Faster rendering
- Maintainability: Easier updates
- Bundle size: Smaller app

## 📋 Implementation Tasks

### Task Order (IMPORTANT - Incremental approach):

#### 1. Identify and Extract Common Patterns
```bash
echo "=== FINDING DUPLICATION ==="

# Find duplicate code patterns
jscpd src/screens/marketing src/components/marketing src/hooks/marketing \
  --min-lines 5 --min-tokens 50 --format json > duplication.json

# Analyze results
echo "Duplication found:"
jq '.statistics.total.percentage' duplication.json
```

Extract common logic:
```typescript
// Create shared utilities
// src/utils/marketing/common.ts
export function useMarketingState(initialState) {
  // Extract common state management
}

export function withMarketingLayout(Component) {
  // Extract common layout wrapper
}
```

#### 2. Optimize Component Rendering
```typescript
// Add memoization
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(Component, (prev, next) => {
  // Custom comparison
});

// Use useMemo for expensive calculations
const processedData = useMemo(() => {
  return expensiveProcessing(rawData);
}, [rawData]);

// Use useCallback for stable references
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  // Handler logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

#### 3. Implement Code Splitting
```typescript
// Lazy load heavy components
const MarketingAnalytics = lazy(() => 
  import('./MarketingAnalyticsScreen')
);

// Use Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingState />}>
  <MarketingAnalytics />
</Suspense>
```

#### 4. Optimize Bundle Size
```bash
# Analyze bundle
npx react-native-bundle-visualizer

# Remove unused imports
npx unimported

# Tree shake properly
```

#### 5. Consolidate Styles
```typescript
// BEFORE: Inline styles everywhere
<View style={{ padding: 16, margin: 8 }}>

// AFTER: Centralized theme
<View style={styles.container}>

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: theme.spacing.md,
    margin: theme.spacing.sm
  }
});
```

### Task Checklist:
- [ ] Extract common patterns → TEST → MEASURE → COMMIT
- [ ] Optimize rendering → TEST → MEASURE → COMMIT
- [ ] Implement code splitting → TEST → MEASURE → COMMIT
- [ ] Reduce bundle size → TEST → MEASURE → COMMIT
- [ ] Consolidate styles → TEST → MEASURE → COMMIT

## ✅ Test Requirements

### Tests Must Continue Passing:
```bash
# After each refactor
npm run test:marketing:all

# If any test fails
echo "❌ Refactor broke tests - reverting"
git reset --hard
# Try different approach
```

### Performance Validation:
```bash
# Measure before and after
BEFORE=$(npx react-native-performance measure)
# Do refactor
AFTER=$(npx react-native-performance measure)

# Calculate improvement
IMPROVEMENT=$(echo "scale=2; (($BEFORE - $AFTER) / $BEFORE) * 100" | bc)
echo "Performance improved: ${IMPROVEMENT}%"
```

## 🔄 Self-Improvement Protocol

### After Each Refactor:
1. **Measure**: Impact on metrics
2. **Validate**: Tests still pass
3. **Compare**: Before vs after
4. **Document**: What improved
5. **Learn**: What worked best

### Continuous Monitoring:
```bash
# Watch metrics during refactor
watch -n 5 "npm run test:marketing:all 2>&1 | grep passing"

# Monitor bundle size
watch -n 10 "du -sh dist/bundle.js"

# Track performance
watch -n 10 "npx react-native-performance measure"
```

## 🚫 Regression Prevention

### Before EVERY Change:
```bash
# Save current state
git stash
git checkout -b refactor-backup

# Capture metrics
npm run test:marketing:all 2>&1 > before-tests.txt
npx react-native-performance measure > before-perf.txt
du -sh dist/bundle.js > before-size.txt

# After refactor
npm run test:marketing:all 2>&1 > after-tests.txt

# Compare
if ! diff before-tests.txt after-tests.txt > /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Tests regressed!"
    git reset --hard
    exit 1
fi
```

### Regression Rules:
- NEVER break existing tests
- NEVER degrade performance
- NEVER increase bundle size
- ALWAYS preserve functionality

## ⚠️ Critical Technical Decisions

### ✅ ALWAYS:
- Test after each change: Catch regressions early
- Measure improvements: Quantify benefits
- Refactor incrementally: Reduce risk
- Preserve behavior: Refactoring != rewriting

### ❌ NEVER:
- Change functionality: That's not refactoring
- Skip tests: Leads to regressions
- Big bang refactor: Too risky
- Ignore metrics: Can't prove improvement

### Decision Matrix:
| Scenario | Right Choice | Wrong Choice | Why |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| Duplicate code | Extract to utility | Leave duplicated | Maintenance |
| Slow render | Add memoization | Ignore | Performance |
| Large bundle | Code split | Ship as-is | Load time |
| Complex logic | Simplify | Leave complex | Readability |

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Tests fail after refactor
**Symptoms**: Previously passing tests fail
**Cause**: Changed behavior unintentionally
**Solution**:
```bash
# Revert and try smaller change
git reset --hard
# Make smaller, incremental changes
# Test after each small change
```

### Issue: Performance worse after optimization
**Symptoms**: Metrics show degradation
**Cause**: Over-optimization or wrong technique
**Solution**:
```typescript
// Profile to find actual bottleneck
const Profiler = require('react-devtools-profiler');
// Focus on actual slow parts
// Don't optimize prematurely
```

### Issue: Bundle size increased
**Symptoms**: Larger bundle after refactor
**Cause**: Added dependencies or poor splitting
**Solution**:
```bash
# Analyze what increased
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/stats.json
# Remove unnecessary imports
# Check tree shaking
```

## 📚 Study These Examples

### Before starting, study:
1. **React optimization guides** - Memoization patterns
2. **Bundle optimization** - Code splitting techniques
3. **Performance profiling** - Finding bottlenecks

### Key Patterns to Notice:
- When to use React.memo
- Where to split code
- How to measure impact
- Incremental refactoring

### Copy These Patterns:
```typescript
// Optimization pattern
const OptimizedComponent = React.memo(
  Component,
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // Only re-render if important props change
    return prevProps.id === nextProps.id &&
           prevProps.version === nextProps.version;
  }
);

// Code splitting pattern
const HeavyFeature = lazy(() =>
  import(
    /* webpackChunkName: "heavy-feature" */
    './HeavyFeature'
  )
);
```

## 🚀 REMEMBER

You're refactoring to IMPROVE, not to change. Every modification must be validated with tests and metrics. Small, incremental changes are safer than big rewrites.

**Measure → Refactor → Test → Validate → Commit**
