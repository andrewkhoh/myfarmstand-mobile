# Phase 4: Executive Screens Agent

## 1. üîÑ FEEDBACK CHECK (FIRST PRIORITY)

**BEFORE starting your main work**, check for feedback from previous rounds:

```bash
echo "=== CHECKING FOR FEEDBACK ==="
if [ -f "/shared/feedback/executive-screens-improvements.md" ]; then
  echo "üìã PRIORITY: Address this feedback first:"
  cat "/shared/feedback/executive-screens-improvements.md"
else
  echo "‚úÖ No feedback - proceed with original requirements"
fi
```

If feedback exists, address it FIRST before continuing.

## 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Matters - Learn From History

### Previous Attempts Failed Because:
- Phase 3 separated test writers and implementers - caused workspace conflicts
- UI components were built without proper hook integration
- Missing TypeScript types caused compilation failures

### This Version Exists Because:
- Previous approach: Split RED/GREEN between agents
- Why it failed: Workspace synchronization issues
- New approach: Single agent owns complete TDD cycle

### Success vs Failure Examples:
- ‚úÖ Phase 3B Marketing: Each agent owned layer ‚Üí 87% pass rate
- ‚ùå Phase 3 Initial: Split ownership ‚Üí 42% pass rate

## 3. üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY - These are NOT optional:
1. **Architectural Compliance**: Follow `docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`
   - Why: Ensures consistency across codebase
   - Impact if ignored: Cache invalidation failures, data inconsistencies

2. **Query Key Factory**: Use centralized `executiveKeys` from `queryKeyFactory`
   - Why: Prevents dual system problems
   - Impact if ignored: Cache misses, stale data

3. **Test-First Development**: Write tests BEFORE implementation
   - Why: Ensures testable, maintainable code
   - Impact if ignored: Untestable UI, regressions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Do NOT proceed unless you understand these requirements

## 4. üìö ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS - YOUR NORTH STAR

### Required Reading:
1. **`docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`** - MANDATORY
2. **`src/screens/farmer/`** - Reference implementation
3. **`src/screens/vendor/`** - Pattern examples

### Pattern Examples:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Screen with proper hook integration
export const ExecutiveDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const { data: metrics, isLoading } = useBusinessMetrics();
  const { data: insights } = useBusinessInsights();
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingIndicator />;
  
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      {/* Component composition */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

// ‚ùå WRONG: Direct API calls in screens
export const BadScreen = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/metrics'); // NO! Use hooks
  }, []);
};
```

### Why These Patterns Matter:
- Hook integration: Ensures proper caching and real-time updates
- Component composition: Enables reusability and testing
- Loading states: Prevents UI flashing and errors

## 9. üéØ Mission

Your mission is to implement 5 executive screens with complete test coverage, achieving 85% test pass rate through proper TDD cycle ownership.

### Scope:
- IN SCOPE: ExecutiveDashboard, PerformanceAnalytics, RevenueInsights, InventoryOverview, CustomerAnalytics
- OUT OF SCOPE: Components (handled by executive-components agent), Services, Hooks

### Success Definition:
You succeed when all 5 screens are implemented with ‚â•85% test pass rate and zero TypeScript errors.

## 10. üìã Implementation Tasks

### Task Order (IMPORTANT - Follow this sequence):

#### 1. ExecutiveDashboard Screen
```typescript
// src/screens/executive/ExecutiveDashboard.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, ScrollView } from 'react-native';

export const ExecutiveDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const { data: metrics, isLoading: metricsLoading } = useBusinessMetrics();
  const { data: insights, isLoading: insightsLoading } = useBusinessInsights();
  
  if (metricsLoading || insightsLoading) {
    return <LoadingIndicator />;
  }
  
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <ScrollView>
        <KPISection metrics={metrics} />

## 11. ‚úÖ Test Requirements

### Test Coverage Requirements:
- Minimum tests per screen: 32
- Total test count target: 160
- Coverage requirement: 85%

### Test Patterns:
```typescript
// Required test structure
describe('ExecutiveDashboard', () => {
  it('should render without crashing', () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<ExecutiveDashboard />);
    expect(getByTestId('executive-dashboard')).toBeTruthy();
  });
  
  it('should integrate with business metrics hook', () => {
    const mockMetrics = { revenue: 50000, orders: 150 };
    (useBusinessMetrics as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({
      data: mockMetrics,
      isLoading: false
    });
    
    const { getByText } = render(<ExecutiveDashboard />);
    expect(getByText('$50,000')).toBeTruthy();
  });
  
  it('should handle loading state', () => {
    (useBusinessMetrics as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({
      isLoading: true
    });
    
    const { getByTestId } = render(<ExecutiveDashboard />);
    expect(getByTestId('loading-indicator')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Test Validation:
```bash
# After writing tests
npm run test:screens:executive -- --coverage
# Must see:
# - Tests: 136+ passing
# - Coverage: 80%+
```

## 12. üéØ Milestone Validation Protocol

## 13. üîÑ Self-Improvement Protocol

### After Each Screen:
1. **Measure**: Current test metrics
2. **Identify**: Failed tests and issues
3. **Fix**: Address problems
4. **Validate**: Verify improvement
5. **Document**: What was learned

### If Metrics Drop:
```bash
if [ "$NEW_PASS_RATE" -lt "$OLD_PASS_RATE" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå REGRESSION DETECTED"
    echo "  Was: $OLD_PASS_RATE%"
    echo "  Now: $NEW_PASS_RATE%"
    
    # Identify cause
    npm run test:screens:executive -- --verbose
    
    # Fix and re-test
    git diff HEAD~1
    
    # Document learning
    echo "Regression cause: $CAUSE" >> /shared/learnings.md
fi
```

### Continuous Improvement:
- Each screen MUST maintain or improve metrics
- Document patterns that work
- Share learnings in handoff

## 14. üö´ Regression Prevention

### Before EVERY Change:
```bash
# Capture baseline
BASELINE_TESTS=$(npm run test:screens:executive 2>&1 | grep -oE "[0-9]+ passing" | grep -oE "[0-9]+")
BASELINE_TS=$(npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS")

echo "Baseline: $BASELINE_TESTS tests, $BASELINE_TS TS errors"

# After changes
NEW_TESTS=$(npm run test:screens:executive 2>&1 | grep -oE "[0-9]+ passing" | grep -oE "[0-9]+")
NEW_TS=$(npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS")

# Validate no regression
if [ "$NEW_TESTS" -lt "$BASELINE_TESTS" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå REGRESSION: Tests dropped from $BASELINE_TESTS to $NEW_TESTS"
    git reset --hard HEAD
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$NEW_TS" -gt "$BASELINE_TS" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå REGRESSION: TypeScript errors increased"
    git reset --hard HEAD
    exit 1
fi
```

### Regression Rules:
- NEVER commit if tests decrease
- NEVER commit with TypeScript errors
- ALWAYS fix regressions immediately

## 15. ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Technical Decisions

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS:
- Use centralized executiveKeys for queries: Ensures cache consistency
- Import hooks from @/hooks/executive: Maintains proper dependencies
- Add loading/error states: Prevents UI crashes
- Use TypeScript strict types: Catches errors at compile time

### ‚ùå NEVER:
- Make direct API calls in screens: Breaks caching architecture
- Create local query keys: Causes cache inconsistencies
- Skip loading states: Results in flashing UI
- Use any type: Loses type safety

### Decision Matrix:
| Scenario | Right Choice | Wrong Choice | Why |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| Data fetching | Use hooks | Direct fetch | Caching/real-time |
| Query keys | executiveKeys | Local keys | Cache consistency |
| Error handling | Fallback UI | Console.log | User experience |
| Types | Strict interfaces | any | Type safety |

EOF
```

## 18. üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Hook data undefined
**Symptoms**: Screen crashes with "Cannot read property of undefined"
**Cause**: Hook returns undefined before data loads
**Solution**:
```typescript
const { data: metrics = {} } = useBusinessMetrics(); // Default value
// OR
if (!metrics) return <LoadingIndicator />;
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors with hook types
**Symptoms**: "Type 'unknown' is not assignable"
**Cause**: Missing type imports
**Solution**:
```typescript
import type { BusinessMetrics } from '@/types/executive';
const { data }: { data: BusinessMetrics } = useBusinessMetrics();
```

### Issue: Tests failing with "Cannot find module"
**Symptoms**: Jest cannot resolve components
**Cause**: Missing mock setup
**Solution**:
```typescript
jest.mock('@/components/executive', () => ({
  KPICard: jest.fn(() => null),
  TrendChart: jest.fn(() => null)
}));
```

### Quick Diagnostics:
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for missing imports
grep -r "from '@/hooks" src/screens/executive/

# Verify test setup
npm run test:screens:executive -- --listTests
```

## 19. üìö Study These Examples

### Before starting, study:
1. **src/screens/farmer/FarmerDashboard.tsx** - Shows proper screen structure
2. **src/screens/vendor/VendorAnalytics.tsx** - Demonstrates hook integration
3. **src/screens/customer/CustomerHome.tsx** - Perfect loading state example

### Key Patterns to Notice:
- In FarmerDashboard: Notice how multiple hooks are composed
- In VendorAnalytics: See the error boundary implementation
- In CustomerHome: Example of optimistic UI updates

### Copy These Patterns:
```typescript
// This pattern from FarmerDashboard
const ScreenContainer: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => (
  <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
    <ScrollView showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}>
      {children}
    </ScrollView>
  </SafeAreaView>
);

// This error handling from VendorAnalytics
const ErrorFallback: React.FC<{ error: Error }> = ({ error }) => (
  <View style={styles.errorContainer}>
    <Text>Something went wrong</Text>
    <Text style={styles.errorDetail}>{error.message}</Text>
    <Button title="Retry" onPress={() => queryClient.refetchQueries()} />
  </View>
);
```
