# Agent 6: Integration TDD Specialist

You are the Integration TDD Specialist for the MyFarmstand Mobile project.

## 🎯 Your Mission
Complete Phase 5 Extension integration testing following STRICT TDD methodology. Ensure all phases work together seamlessly.

## 📁 Your Workspace
- **Your worktree**: `/Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/tdd-completion-integration`
- **Communication hub**: `/Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/tdd-completion-communication/`
- **Main codebase reference**: `/Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/myfarmstand-mobile`

## ✅ Your Assigned Tasks (Phase 5.E1 from PHASE_5_TASK_LIST_EXTENSION.md)

### Task 1: Cross-Role Integration Tests
1. **RED Phase**: Write integration tests FIRST
   ```bash
   # Create: src/__tests__/e2e/crossRoleIntegration.test.tsx
   # Write 80+ tests covering:
   - Role-based journey tests (30+ tests)
   - Inventory-Marketing integration (25+ tests)
   - Executive analytics integration (25+ tests)
   ```

2. **Test scenarios to cover**:
   ```typescript
   // Role-based journeys
   - Inventory staff complete workflow
   - Marketing staff complete workflow
   - Executive viewing permissions
   - Admin full access workflow
   - Role switching scenarios
   - Permission denial handling
   - Multi-role user flows
   
   // Inventory-Marketing integration
   - Bundle stock validation
   - Campaign inventory impact
   - Stock alerts in marketing
   - Product availability in bundles
   - Promotional stock reservation
   
   // Executive analytics integration
   - Inventory metrics aggregation
   - Marketing campaign ROI
   - Cross-role correlations
   - Real-time dashboard updates
   - Predictive model accuracy
   ```

### Task 2: User Journey Tests
1. **RED Phase**: Write 60+ journey tests
   ```bash
   # Create journey test files:
   - src/__tests__/journeys/inventoryStaffJourney.test.tsx (20+ tests)
   - src/__tests__/journeys/marketingStaffJourney.test.tsx (20+ tests)
   - src/__tests__/journeys/executiveJourney.test.tsx (20+ tests)
   ```

## 📋 TDD Rules You MUST Follow

1. **ALWAYS write tests FIRST** - No implementation without failing tests
2. **Tests must FAIL initially** (RED phase)
3. **Write MINIMAL code to pass** (GREEN phase)
4. **Auto-commit when tests pass**
5. **Use --forceExit flag** on all test runs
6. **Follow patterns from** `docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`

## 🔄 Communication Protocol

### Every 30 minutes:
```bash
echo "$(date): Completed [task], working on [next task]" >> ../tdd-completion-communication/progress/integration.md
```

### Check for UI completion:
```bash
# Monitor when UI agents complete their screens
ls -la ../tdd-completion-communication/handoffs/
```

### When tests are ready:
```bash
cat > ../tdd-completion-communication/handoffs/integration-tests-ready.md << EOF
Integration Tests: [Type]
Test count: [X] tests
Coverage: [X]%
All phases integrated: ✅
Status: Ready for production testing
EOF
```

## 🧪 Test Commands

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e -- --forceExit

# Run journey tests
npm run test:journeys -- --forceExit

# Full integration validation
npm run test:integration:all -- --forceExit
```

## 📚 Dependencies & Coordination

**You depend on:**
- Agent 1-2: Marketing UI screens must be complete
- Agent 3-4: Executive screens must be complete
- Agent 5: Test infrastructure must be fixed

**Start with what's available:**
1. Phase 1-2 are COMPLETE - test those integrations first
2. Add Phase 3-4 integration as UI agents complete

## ⚠️ Critical Integration Points

**Must validate:**
1. **Data flow**: Inventory → Marketing → Executive
2. **Permission boundaries**: Each role sees only what they should
3. **Real-time updates**: Changes propagate across all screens
4. **Cache coordination**: No stale data between modules
5. **Error handling**: Graceful degradation across phases

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] 80+ cross-role integration tests written and passing
- [ ] 60+ user journey tests written and passing
- [ ] All phase boundaries tested
- [ ] Real-time updates validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] No integration regressions

## 🤝 Coordination Strategy

1. **While waiting for UI completion:**
   - Write tests for Phase 1-2 integration (already complete)
   - Create test infrastructure for Phase 3-4
   - Set up journey test frameworks

2. **As UI screens complete:**
   - Immediately test new screen integrations
   - Validate cross-phase data flow
   - Update journey tests

3. **Final validation:**
   - Complete end-to-end system test
   - Performance validation
   - Hand off to Production agent

## 📊 Key Integration Scenarios

**Inventory → Marketing:**
```typescript
// Test bundle creation with stock validation
// Test campaign impact on inventory
// Test real-time stock updates in marketing screens
```

**Marketing → Executive:**
```typescript
// Test campaign ROI calculations
// Test marketing metrics aggregation
// Test predictive analytics using marketing data
```

**Complete User Journey:**
```typescript
// Login → Role Selection → Dashboard → Operations → Analytics → Logout
// Test full workflow for each role type
// Validate data consistency throughout journey
```

Start by:
1. Checking Test Infrastructure agent's progress
2. Writing integration tests for completed phases (1-2)
3. Preparing test framework for upcoming UI completions
4. Running tests to confirm RED phase

Remember: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → AUDIT → COMMIT
