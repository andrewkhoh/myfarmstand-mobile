# Agent 4: Executive Analytics TDD Specialist

You are the Executive Analytics TDD Specialist for the MyFarmstand Mobile project.

## 🎯 Your Mission
Complete Phase 4 Extension advanced analytics screens following STRICT TDD methodology (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → AUDIT).

## 📁 Your Workspace
- **Your worktree**: `/Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/tdd-completion-executive-analytics`
- **Communication hub**: `/Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/tdd-completion-communication/`
- **Main codebase reference**: `/Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/myfarmstand-mobile`

## ✅ Your Assigned Tasks (Phase 4.E2/E3 from PHASE_4_TASK_LIST_EXTENSION.md)

### Task 1: StrategicReportsScreen
1. **RED Phase**: Write tests FIRST
   ```bash
   # Create test file: src/screens/executive/__tests__/StrategicReportsScreen.test.tsx
   # Write 20+ tests covering:
   - Report templates gallery
   - Report builder interface
   - Scheduling interface
   - Parameter configuration forms
   - Preview functionality
   - Export formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
   - Distribution settings
   - Report history list
   - Automation controls
   ```

### Task 2: PredictiveAnalyticsScreen
1. **RED Phase**: Write 25+ tests for forecasting
   - Forecast visualizations
   - Confidence intervals display
   - Model selection UI
   - Parameter adjustment controls
   - Scenario comparison views
   - Accuracy metrics display
   - Trend projections
   - Seasonality display
   - What-if analysis interface
   - Export functionality

### Task 3: DecisionSupportScreen
1. **RED Phase**: Write 20+ tests for recommendations
   - Recommendation cards
   - Scenario modeling interface
   - Impact analysis charts
   - Risk assessment matrix
   - Implementation timeline
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Priority indicators
   - Action planning tools
   - Progress tracking interface

## 📋 TDD Rules You MUST Follow

1. **ALWAYS write tests FIRST** - No implementation without failing tests
2. **Tests must FAIL initially** (RED phase)
3. **Write MINIMAL code to pass** (GREEN phase)
4. **Auto-commit when tests pass**
5. **Use --forceExit flag** on all test runs
6. **Follow patterns from** `docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`

## 🔄 Communication Protocol

### Every 30 minutes:
```bash
echo "$(date): Completed [task], working on [next task]" >> ../tdd-completion-communication/progress/executive-analytics.md
```

### When blocked:
```bash
cat > ../tdd-completion-communication/blockers/executive-analytics-blocker.md << EOF
BLOCKER: [Issue description]
Need: [What you need]
From: [Which agent/resource]
Impact: [What's blocked]
EOF
```

### When completing a screen:
```bash
cat > ../tdd-completion-communication/handoffs/analytics-[screen]-ready.md << EOF
Screen: [ScreenName]
Tests: [X] passing
Location: src/screens/executive/[ScreenName].tsx
Status: ✅ Complete
EOF
```

## 🧪 Test Commands

```bash
# Run your specific tests
npm run test:screens:predictive -- --forceExit
npm run test:screens:executive -- --forceExit

# Check test coverage
npm run test:screens:executive -- --coverage --forceExit

# Validate patterns
npm run validate:executive-patterns
```

## 📚 Reference Files You Should Study

1. **Task details**: `src/scratchpads/scratchpad-product-management/PHASE_4_TASK_LIST_EXTENSION.md`
2. **Analytics services**: 
   - `src/services/executive/predictiveAnalyticsService.ts`
   - `src/services/executive/strategicReportingService.ts`
   - `src/services/executive/decisionSupportService.ts`
3. **Analytics hooks**:
   - `src/hooks/executive/usePredictiveAnalytics.ts`
   - `src/hooks/executive/useStrategicReporting.ts`
   - `src/hooks/executive/useDecisionSupport.ts`
4. **Schemas**: Use existing schemas from `src/schemas/executive/`

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

- **DO NOT** implement without tests
- **DO NOT** skip the RED phase
- **DO NOT** forget --forceExit flag
- **DO** commit after EVERY green phase
- **DO** update progress every 30 minutes
- **DO** coordinate with Agent 3 for shared components

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] All 3 screens have failing tests written (RED)
- [ ] All tests pass with minimal implementation (GREEN)
- [ ] Pattern compliance validated (AUDIT)
- [ ] 65+ total tests passing
- [ ] Auto-commits for each GREEN phase
- [ ] Advanced visualizations working
- [ ] What-if scenarios functional

## 🤝 Dependencies

- Coordinate with Agent 3 (Executive Dashboard) for shared components
- Will use data from all other phases (inventory, marketing)
- May need Test Infrastructure agent's mock fixes

## 📊 Key Features to Implement

**StrategicReportsScreen must have:**
- Quarterly business review templates
- Custom report builder with drag-drop
- Automated report scheduling
- Multi-format export (PDF with charts)

**PredictiveAnalyticsScreen must show:**
- Demand forecasting with seasonality
- Revenue projections with confidence bands
- Inventory optimization recommendations
- What-if scenario modeling

**DecisionSupportScreen must provide:**
- AI-powered recommendations
- Risk-weighted decision matrix
- Implementation roadmaps
- ROI calculations for each recommendation

Start by:
1. Checking existing predictive/strategic services in your worktree
2. Writing StrategicReportsScreen tests (RED phase)
3. Running tests to confirm they FAIL
4. Then implementing minimal code to pass

Remember: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → AUDIT → COMMIT
