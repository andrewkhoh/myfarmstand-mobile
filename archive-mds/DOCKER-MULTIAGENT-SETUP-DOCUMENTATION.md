# Docker Multi-Agent Setup - Complete Documentation & Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Docker multi-agent setup partially works but has critical flaws that prevent proper operation and monitoring. Agents completed work on August 27, but the infrastructure couldn't properly capture or track it.

## Current State (As of August 28, 2025)

### What Works ✅
- Docker containers start and run
- Authentication is shared via `~/.claude` mount
- Agents DID complete work (August 27, 17:41-21:52 UTC)
- Communication directories are properly mounted
- Heartbeat monitoring functions

### What's Broken ❌
- **Wrong CLI flag**: Using `--dangerously-skip-permissions` instead of `--dangerously-skip-permission-checks`
- **One-shot execution**: Using `-p` flag runs Claude once and exits
- **No work capture**: File operations and tool usage not logged
- **No commits**: Agents created files but didn't commit to git
- **Poor handoffs**: Dependency system relies on completion markers that aren't created
- **Misleading status**: Shows "running" but agents are idle after initial work

## Evidence of Completed Work

### role-services-agent (Completed Aug 27, 21:52)
- Created `RolePermissionService` with 16 tests
- Created `UserRoleService` with 15+ tests
- Fixed `SimplifiedSupabaseMock` TypeScript errors
- 31+ total tests (exceeds requirements)
- 100% pattern compliance achieved

### Other Agents
- permission-ui-agent: Created UI components
- role-navigation-agent: Made 1 commit (687d2d9)
- role-screens-agent: Made 1 commit (d10ea7b)
- integration-agent: Performed comprehensive audit (found failures)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Execution Model Mismatch
**Problem**: The entrypoint script (`entrypoint-enhanced.sh`) treats Claude as a simple command-line tool:
```bash
# Line 185 - One-shot query mode
OUTPUT=$(claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "$PROMPT" 2>&1)
```

**Reality**: Agents need interactive sessions for:
- Multiple tool uses (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Iterative problem solving
- Testing and verification loops
- Git operations

### 2. Logging Architecture Failure
The script only captures simple patterns (lines 17-53):
- `"Using tool:"` → Log tool name
- `"File modified:"` → Log filename
- `"Error:"` → Log error

**Missing**:
- Actual file contents
- Tool outputs
- Test results details
- Git operations
- Multi-line outputs

### 3. State Management Issues
- No persistent state between container restarts
- Agents can't resume interrupted work
- No way to track partial progress
- Completion markers not properly created

## Why You See Heartbeats But No Work

1. **Initial Run** (Aug 27): Claude ran once, did work, then exited
2. **Container Restarts** (Aug 27 22:36+): New containers start but:
   - Claude runs authentication check (hangs due to wrong flag)
   - Never gets to re-run the prompt
   - Only heartbeat process continues
3. **Result**: Containers appear "healthy" but do nothing

## Monitoring & Logging Gaps

### Current Monitoring
```
/shared/progress/*.md     → Only heartbeats
/shared/logs/*.log        → Partial output capture
/shared/status/*.json     → Basic status updates
/shared/handoffs/*.md     → Mostly missing
```

### What's Missing
- Real-time tool execution logs
- File diff tracking
- Test execution results
- Git operation logs
- Inter-agent communication
- Work product artifacts

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Fix CLI Execution (Immediate)
```bash
# Replace line 134
- AUTH_CHECK=$(echo "test" | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "Say yes" 2>&1)
+ AUTH_CHECK=$(echo "test" | claude --dangerously-skip-permission-checks -p "Say yes" 2>&1)

# Replace line 185-186 (one-shot) with interactive mode
- OUTPUT=$(claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "$PROMPT" 2>&1)
+ cat "/prompts/${AGENT_NAME}-agent.md" | claude --dangerously-skip-permission-checks 2>&1 | tee -a "$DETAILED_LOG"
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging Pipeline
```bash
# Create detailed execution log
claude --dangerously-skip-permission-checks 2>&1 | while read -r line; do
    # Log everything
    echo "$line" >> "$DETAILED_LOG"
    
    # Parse for specific patterns
    if [[ "$line" =~ ^"Using tool:" ]]; then
        TOOL="${line#Using tool: }"
        echo "$(date): Tool: $TOOL" >> "$PROGRESS_FILE"
        
        # Capture next N lines as tool output
        for i in {1..50}; do
            read -r tool_output
            echo "$tool_output" >> "$TOOL_LOG"
        done
    fi
done
```

### 3. State Persistence
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml addition
volumes:
  - ./volumes/state/${AGENT_NAME}:/state:rw
  
environment:
  - STATE_DIR=/state
  - RESUME_ON_RESTART=true
```

### 4. Proper Handoff System
```bash
# After successful completion
create_handoff() {
    cat > "/shared/handoffs/${AGENT_NAME}-complete.md" << EOF
# ${AGENT_NAME} Handoff
Completed: $(date)
## Work Products
$(find /workspace -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -20)
## Tests Created
$(grep -l "describe\|test\|it(" /workspace/src/**/*.test.ts)
## Git Status
$(cd /workspace && git status --short)
EOF
}
```

### 5. Real-time Monitoring Dashboard
Create a monitoring script that shows:
- Active Claude processes
- Files being modified in real-time
- Tool executions as they happen
- Git operations
- Test results

## Verification Steps

1. **Check if work exists**:
```bash
cd docker/volumes/phase1-role-foundation-role-services
git status  # Shows uncommitted changes
ls -la src/services/  # Shows created services
```

2. **Check logs for evidence**:
```bash
grep "RolePermissionService\|UserRoleService" logs/role-services.log
```

3. **Verify container state**:
```bash
docker exec role-services-agent ps aux | grep claude
```

## Conclusion

The multi-agent setup is **architecturally flawed** but **did produce work**. The main issues are:

1. **Execution**: One-shot mode prevents iterative work
2. **Monitoring**: Can't see what agents are actually doing
3. **Persistence**: Work exists but isn't committed
4. **Handoffs**: Agents can't properly communicate completion

The fix requires:
- Correcting CLI flags
- Using interactive mode
- Implementing proper logging
- Adding state persistence
- Creating real handoff artifacts

The agents DID complete Phase 1 work (with failures noted by integration agent), but the infrastructure couldn't properly capture, monitor, or preserve it.
