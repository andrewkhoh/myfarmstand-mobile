## 🚨 Critical Technical Debts

### 1. **Widespread Test Failures**
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL

#### Service Layer Tests (100% Failure Rate)
- `orderService.test.ts` - Mock setup issues (`mockGetProductStock.mockReturnValue is not a function`)
- `cartService.test.ts` - Mock configuration problems
- `paymentService.test.ts` - Test infrastructure broken
- `inventoryService.test.ts` - Async handling issues
- `stockMovementService.test.ts` - Mock setup failures

#### Hook Tests (Partial Failures)
- `useInventoryOperations.test.tsx` - 17 failures (mutation state properties missing)
- `useInventoryItems.test.tsx` - Query state handling issues
- `useMarketingCampaigns.test.tsx` - Multiple test failures

**Root Causes**:
- Inconsistent mock setup patterns
- Missing test infrastructure updates after refactoring
- Race condition in async test handling
- Incomplete mutation/query state mocking

### 2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL

#### Major Error Patterns
- `patternComplianceAudit.test.ts` - 100+ syntax errors
- `frontendOptimization.ts` - 300+ parsing errors
- Missing type definitions
- Unterminated literals and malformed syntax

**Impact**: Application cannot compile for production build

### 3. **Missing Linting Infrastructure**
**Severity**: 🟡 HIGH

- ESLint not installed/configured
- No automated code quality checks
- No pre-commit linting enforcement
- Missing `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`

### 4. **Architectural Pattern Violations**
**Severity**: 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH

Based on audit against `docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`:

#### Pattern Violations Found
1. **Dual Query Key Systems** (Pattern violation)
   - Some hooks creating local query key factories alongside centralized ones
   - Inconsistent invalidation patterns

2. **Missing Validation Monitoring**
   - Not all services implement `ValidationMonitor` tracking
   - Success/failure metrics incomplete

3. **Incomplete Error Handling**
   - Missing user-friendly error messages in some services
   - No recovery suggestions in certain error paths

4. **Database-Interface Misalignment**
   - Some schemas not properly validating against `database.generated.ts`
   - Transformation schemas incomplete

## 📝 Conclusion

The codebase shows significant progress in implementing the planned features but has **critical quality issues** that prevent production deployment:

1. **Test infrastructure is broken** - Preventing validation of functionality
2. **TypeScript compilation failing** - Cannot build for production
3. **Incomplete feature implementation** - Missing screens and functionality
4. **Architectural pattern violations** - Creating maintenance debt

**Recommendation**: Focus on stabilizing the existing code before adding new features. The test infrastructure and TypeScript issues must be resolved immediately as they block all deployment paths.

**Estimated Time to Production Ready**: 4-5 weeks with dedicated effort
