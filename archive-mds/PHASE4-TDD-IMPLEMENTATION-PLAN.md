# Phase 4 Executive Analytics - TDD Implementation Plan

## üî¥ TDD Philosophy: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR ‚Üí AUDIT

Following the strict TDD approach where we:
1. **Write tests FIRST** (RED phase - tests fail)
2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
3. **Optimize and refactor** (REFACTOR phase)
4. **Validate compliance** (AUDIT phase)

## üìä Current TDD Status Analysis

### What's Actually Implemented (Phase 4 Partial Implementation)

Based on codebase scan, we have:
- ‚úÖ Database schema exists (`database/executive-analytics-test-schema.sql`)
- ‚úÖ Schema layer exists (businessMetrics, businessIntelligence, strategicReporting, predictiveAnalytics)
- ‚úÖ Service layer exists (all 4 services + simple versions)
- ‚úÖ Basic hooks exist (multiple hooks including simple versions)
- ‚ùå NO executive screens (0% - ExecutiveDashboard, BusinessIntelligence, etc.)
- ‚ùå NO executive UI components (0% - KPICard, TrendChart, etc.)
- ‚ùå NO decision support features (0% - recommendations, scenarios)
- ‚ùå NO cross-role correlation UI (0% - visualization, insights)

### TDD Implementation Status

| Component | Files Exist | Tests Written | Tests Passing | TDD Status |
|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Database | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚úÖ Schema exists | N/A | Complete |
| Schemas | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚úÖ Contract tests exist | Unknown | Needs validation |
| Services | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚úÖ Tests exist | Unknown | Needs validation |
| Hooks | ‚úÖ 80% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial tests | Unknown | Needs completion |
| Screens | ‚ùå 0% | ‚ùå 0/5 screens | 0% | Not Started |
| Components | ‚ùå 0% | ‚ùå 0/15 components | 0% | Not Started |
| Integration | ‚ö†Ô∏è 20% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Some exist | Unknown | Needs expansion |

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Create Test Infrastructure Configs**
```bash
# Jest configurations for Phase 4
- jest.config.screens.executive.js
- jest.config.components.executive.js
- jest.config.integration.executive.js
- jest.config.decision.js
```

### 2. **Setup Test Data Factories**
```typescript
// Test data factories needed
- src/test/factories/executive/metrics.factory.ts
- src/test/factories/executive/insights.factory.ts
- src/test/factories/executive/forecasts.factory.ts
- src/test/factories/executive/reports.factory.ts
- src/test/factories/executive/decisions.factory.ts
```

### 3. **Prepare Communication Channels**
```bash
# Agent communication setup
mkdir -p docker/volumes/communication/phase4/{blockers,handoffs,progress}
touch docker/volumes/communication/phase4/progress/test-writing.md
touch docker/volumes/communication/phase4/handoffs/red-to-green.md
```

### 4. **Launch Phase 4 RED Phase**
```bash
# Start test writing agents
docker-compose -f docker-compose-phase4-tdd.yml up -d \
  phase4-screen-test-writer \
  phase4-component-test-writer \
  phase4-hook-test-writer \
  phase4-integration-test-writer \
  phase4-decision-test-writer
```

### 5. **Monitor Test Writing Progress**
```bash
# Watch test count grow
watch "find src -name '*.test.tsx' -o -name '*.test.ts' | grep executive | wc -l"

# Monitor specific test suites
npm run test:screens:executive -- --listTests | wc -l
npm run test:components:executive -- --listTests | wc -l
```

## üìù TDD Commit Strategy

### Automated Commits on Test Status Change
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "tdd:phase4:red:commit": "npm test && exit 1 || git add -A && git commit -m 'test(executive): Phase 4 RED - tests written and failing'",
    "tdd:phase4:green:commit": "npm test:executive && git add -A && git commit -m 'feat(executive): Phase 4 GREEN - tests passing'",
    "tdd:phase4:refactor:commit": "npm test:executive && npm run lint && git add -A && git commit -m 'refactor(executive): Phase 4 optimized'",
    "tdd:phase4:audit:commit": "npm run validate:patterns && git add -A && git commit -m 'chore(executive): Phase 4 audit complete - 100% compliance'"
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Rules

1. **NO implementation without failing tests** - Every screen, component, and feature must have tests first
2. **Write minimal code to pass tests** - Don't over-engineer in GREEN phase
3. **Refactor only after tests pass** - Performance optimization comes after functionality
4. **Each agent commits when their phase completes** - Maintain atomic commits
5. **Pattern compliance is mandatory** - Follow architectural patterns from docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md
6. **Cross-role integration must be tested** - Ensure data flows correctly between phases 1-3
7. **Real-time updates must work** - Executive dashboards need live data
8. **Performance targets must be met** - Large datasets must be handled efficiently

## üîÑ Cross-Phase Dependencies

### Required from Phase 1 (Role-Based)
- User role context (useUserRole)
- Permission checking (RolePermissionService)
- ValidationMonitor integration

### Required from Phase 2 (Inventory)
- Inventory metrics data
- Stock movement patterns
- Performance indicators

### Required from Phase 3 (Marketing)
- Campaign performance data
- Content engagement metrics
- Bundle analytics

### Query Key Factory Integration
```typescript
// Must extend existing factory, not create new
executiveKeys: {
  all: ['executive'] as const,
  metrics: () => [...executiveKeys.all, 'metrics'] as const,
  insights: () => [...executiveKeys.all, 'insights'] as const,
  forecasts: () => [...executiveKeys.all, 'forecasts'] as const,
  reports: () => [...executiveKeys.all, 'reports'] as const,
  // ... etc
}
```

## üìä Expected Test Distribution

| Layer | Component | Test Count | Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| UI | Executive Screens | 160 | CRITICAL |
| UI | Components | 115 | CRITICAL |
| Hooks | Enhanced Hooks | 80 | HIGH |
| Integration | Cross-Role | 75 | HIGH |
| Features | Decision Support | 70 | MEDIUM |
| **TOTAL** | **Phase 4** | **500+** | - |
