# Urgent Issues Task List

Generated from comprehensive workflow analysis on 2025-01-20

## Critical Integration Gaps (High Priority)

### 1. Implement cross-workflow real-time coordination service
**Issue**: Inventory updates don't immediately reflect in executive dashboards
**Impact**: Decision-making based on stale data
**Location**: Missing real-time bridges between `inventoryService.ts` and `businessMetricsService.ts`
**Status**: Pending

### 2. Add inventory-marketing validation bridge
**Issue**: Marketing campaigns can be scheduled without checking inventory availability
**Impact**: Promising products that may be out of stock
**Location**: No validation bridge between marketing and inventory services
**Status**: Pending

### 3. Fix missing real-time sync between inventory and executive dashboards
**Issue**: Executive dashboards show outdated inventory metrics
**Impact**: Inaccurate business decisions and delayed response to stock issues
**Location**: `src/services/inventory/inventoryService.ts` â†’ `src/services/executive/businessMetricsService.ts`
**Status**: Pending

### 4. Implement coordinated error handling across workflows
**Issue**: Service failures in one workflow don't properly cascade error handling to dependent workflows
**Impact**: Inconsistent error states across the application
**Location**: Missing centralized error coordination service
**Status**: Pending

### 5. Fix cache invalidation dependencies across workflows
**Issue**: Updates in one workflow don't properly invalidate related caches in other workflows
**Impact**: Stale data displayed in dependent components
**Location**: Query key factory lacks cross-workflow invalidation patterns
**Status**: Pending

## Workflow-Specific Gaps

### 6. Resolve missing dashboard hooks in inventory workflow
**Issue**: Dashboard component has TODO comments for missing hook files
**Impact**: Limited functionality in inventory dashboard
**Location**: `src/screens/inventory/InventoryDashboard.tsx:13-15`
**Status**: Pending

### 7. Add error boundaries for inventory operations
**Issue**: Limited error boundaries for inventory operations
**Impact**: Unhandled errors can crash the entire inventory workflow
**Location**: `src/screens/inventory/` components
**Status**: Pending

### 8. Implement cross-campaign dependency validation
**Issue**: No validation for conflicting campaign schedules
**Impact**: Marketing campaigns may conflict or overlap unintentionally
**Location**: Marketing service layer
**Status**: Pending

### 9. Add automated refresh for critical metrics
**Issue**: No automated refresh for critical metrics during peak business hours
**Impact**: Executives working with outdated data during critical decision periods
**Location**: `src/hooks/executive/useBusinessMetrics.ts`
**Status**: Pending

## Role & Security Gaps

### 10. Implement permission inheritance patterns
**Issue**: No clear inheritance patterns for complex permission scenarios
**Impact**: Inconsistent permission handling across role hierarchies
**Location**: `src/services/rolePermissionService.ts`
**Status**: Pending

### 11. Add audit trail for permissions
**Issue**: Limited tracking of permission changes and access attempts
**Impact**: Security and compliance risks, no accountability trail
**Location**: Role-based access control system
**Status**: Pending

### 12. Implement role-based session timeouts
**Issue**: Missing role-based session timeout configurations
**Impact**: Security risk from sessions remaining active too long
**Location**: Authentication and session management layer
**Status**: Pending

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Gaps (Immediate - 2 weeks)
- [ ] Tasks 1-5: Core integration and synchronization issues

### Phase 2: Workflow Fixes (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Tasks 6-9: Specific workflow improvements

### Phase 3: Security Enhancements (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Tasks 10-12: Role and permission system improvements

## Success Criteria

- All workflows have real-time data synchronization
- Cross-workflow operations are validated before execution
- Error states are consistent across all components
- Cache invalidation works correctly across workflow boundaries
- All critical dashboard hooks are implemented
- Error boundaries protect all major workflow components
- Campaign scheduling conflicts are prevented
- Executive metrics refresh automatically during business hours
- Permission inheritance is clear and consistent
- All permission changes are logged and auditable
- Session timeouts are appropriate for each role level

## Notes

- Focus on high-impact, user-facing issues first
- Ensure backward compatibility when implementing fixes
- Add comprehensive tests for all new integration points
- Document all cross-workflow dependencies clearly
