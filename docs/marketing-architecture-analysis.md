## Comparison with Inventory Feature

### Similarities
- Both have hub screens for navigation
- Similar hook patterns for data fetching
- Service layer architecture
- Navigation through Admin stack

### Differences
- Marketing has more complex workflow management
- Marketing includes real-time coordination services
- Marketing has richer component library
- Marketing has more service duplication/confusion
- Inventory has cleaner service implementation
- Inventory has better API integration pattern

## Conclusion

The marketing feature is more complex and feature-rich than the inventory system, with comprehensive campaign management, content workflows, and analytics capabilities. However, it suffers from significant technical debt, particularly in the service layer where multiple implementations create confusion and maintenance challenges.

The immediate focus should be on cleaning up the service layer, removing duplicate implementations, and establishing clear patterns for API integration. The rich set of hooks and components provides a solid foundation for building advanced marketing features once the underlying architecture issues are resolved.

The marketing feature shows signs of rapid development with multiple iterations, evident from the archived tests and backup files. A systematic cleanup and refactoring effort would significantly improve maintainability and developer experience.
