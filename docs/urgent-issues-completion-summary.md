# Urgent Issues - Completion Summary

## Completed Tasks (7 of 12)

### ✅ 1. Implement cross-workflow real-time coordination service
**File**: `src/services/cross-workflow/realtimeCoordinator.ts`
- Created comprehensive real-time coordination service
- Handles inventory → executive, marketing → executive, and inventory → marketing sync
- Integrated with Supabase channels for real-time updates
- Automatically invalidates relevant query caches on workflow changes
- Integrated into App.tsx for automatic initialization

### ✅ 2. Add inventory-marketing validation bridge
**File**: `src/services/cross-workflow/inventoryMarketingBridge.ts`
**Updated**: `src/services/marketing/campaign.service.ts`, `src/services/inventory/inventoryService.ts`
- Validates inventory availability before campaign creation/activation
- Prevents scheduling conflicts between campaigns
- Reserves inventory for active campaigns
- Notifies marketing when inventory levels change
- Blocks campaign activation if insufficient stock

### ✅ 3. Fix missing real-time sync between inventory and executive dashboards
**Integrated in**: `realtimeCoordinator.ts`
- Real-time propagation of inventory updates to executive metrics
- Automatic cache invalidation for executive queries on inventory changes
- Cross-workflow event emission for coordinated updates

### ✅ 4. Implement coordinated error handling across workflows
**File**: `src/services/cross-workflow/errorCoordinator.ts`
**Updated**: `src/services/inventory/inventoryService.ts`, `src/services/marketing/campaign.service.ts`
- Centralized error handling with recovery strategies
- Cascade error handling between workflows
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback strategies for critical failures
- Error history tracking and statistics

### ✅ 5. Fix cache invalidation dependencies across workflows
**Implemented in**: `realtimeCoordinator.ts` and query key updates
- Cross-workflow cache invalidation patterns
- Added executive query keys (metrics, insights, crossRole)
- Automatic invalidation of dependent queries on workflow changes

### ✅ 6. Resolve missing dashboard hooks in inventory workflow
**Fixed**: `src/screens/inventory/InventoryDashboard.tsx`
- Corrected imports for useInventoryDashboard and useInventoryItems hooks
- Removed placeholder implementations
- Dashboard now properly connects to inventory service

### ✅ 7. Add error boundaries for inventory operations
**Created**:
- `src/components/error/InventoryErrorBoundary.tsx` - Base error boundary with retry logic
- `src/components/error/StockOperationErrorBoundary.tsx` - Specialized for stock operations
- `src/components/error/InventoryWorkflowErrorBoundary.tsx` - Workflow-level error handling
**Updated**:
- `src/screens/inventory/InventoryHub.tsx` - Wrapped with InventoryWorkflowErrorBoundary
- `src/screens/inventory/StockManagementScreen.tsx` - Wrapped with StockOperationErrorBoundary
- Error boundaries integrate with errorCoordinator for coordinated recovery
- Auto-recovery with exponential backoff for transient errors
- User-friendly error messages with recovery actions

## Architecture Improvements

### Cross-Workflow Services Created
1. **InventoryMarketingBridge** - Validates and coordinates inventory-marketing operations
2. **RealtimeCoordinator** - Manages real-time sync across all workflows
3. **ErrorCoordinator** - Handles errors with workflow-aware recovery strategies

### Key Integration Points
- **Inventory Service** → Marketing (stock change notifications)
- **Marketing Service** → Inventory (validation before campaigns)
- **Both** → Executive (real-time metric updates)
- **Error Handling** → All workflows (cascading error recovery)

## Remaining Tasks (5)

### High Priority
1. **Implement cross-campaign dependency validation** - Prevent campaign conflicts
2. **Add automated refresh for critical metrics** - Keep executive data fresh

### Security & Compliance
4. **Implement permission inheritance patterns** - Consistent role hierarchy
5. **Add audit trail for permissions** - Track all permission changes
6. **Implement role-based session timeouts** - Security timeout by role level

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `/src/services/cross-workflow/inventoryMarketingBridge.ts`
- `/src/services/cross-workflow/realtimeCoordinator.ts`
- `/src/services/cross-workflow/errorCoordinator.ts`
- `/docs/urgent-issues-todo.md`
- `/docs/urgent-issues-completion-summary.md`

### Modified Files
- `/src/services/inventory/inventoryService.ts` - Added bridge and error coordination
- `/src/services/marketing/campaign.service.ts` - Added inventory validation
- `/src/utils/queryKeyFactory.ts` - Added executive keys and aliases
- `/src/screens/inventory/InventoryDashboard.tsx` - Fixed hook imports
- `/App.tsx` - Integrated realtime coordinator

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test inventory-marketing validation**:
   - Try creating campaign with out-of-stock products
   - Verify campaign pauses when inventory depletes

2. **Test real-time sync**:
   - Update inventory and check executive dashboard
   - Create campaign and verify metrics update

3. **Test error recovery**:
   - Simulate network failures
   - Verify fallback strategies work

4. **Test cache invalidation**:
   - Make cross-workflow changes
   - Verify all dependent data refreshes

## Next Steps

Continue with remaining high-priority tasks:
1. Error boundaries for better UX stability
2. Campaign dependency validation
3. Automated metric refresh

Then address security/compliance tasks for production readiness.
