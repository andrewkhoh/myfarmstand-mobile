# TDD Phase 4 Gap Analysis - Current State Assessment

## Executive Summary
The workspace has **ALL necessary test files and Jest configs** but is missing **5 critical npm scripts** in package.json. This is causing the container to restart repeatedly when the entrypoint tries to run `test:all:executive`.

## Current State Analysis

### Test Files Present
| Volume | Reference Count | Workspace Has | Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| cross-role-integration | 429 | 124 cross-role tests | ✅ Present |
| decision-support | 420 | 124 decision tests | ✅ Present |
| executive-components | 424 | 145 component tests | ✅ Present |
| executive-hooks | 429 | 250 hook tests | ✅ Present |
| executive-screens | 424 | 45 screen tests | ✅ Present |
| **Total** | **2,126** | **698 tests** | ⚠️ Partial |

### Jest Configurations
| Config File | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|---------|
| jest.config.integration.cross-role.js | Cross-role integration | ✅ EXISTS |
| jest.config.decision.js | Decision support | ✅ EXISTS |
| jest.config.components.executive.js | Executive components | ✅ EXISTS |
| jest.config.hooks.executive.js | Executive hooks | ✅ EXISTS |
| jest.config.screens.executive.js | Executive screens | ✅ EXISTS |

**All 32 Jest configs are present and working!** Test discovery confirms they find the correct test files.

### NPM Scripts - THE CRITICAL GAP
| Script | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| test:screens:executive | ✅ EXISTS | Working |
| test:integration:cross-role | ❌ MISSING | Tests can't run |
| test:features:decision | ❌ MISSING | Tests can't run |
| test:components:executive | ❌ MISSING | Tests can't run |
| test:hooks:executive | ❌ MISSING | Tests can't run |
| test:all:executive | ❌ MISSING | **Container restarts!** |

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Restart Cycle Problem
1. Agent starts and reads feedback
2. Agent may try to add scripts or fix tests
3. Entrypoint runs `npm run test:all:executive` for verification
4. Script doesn't exist → returns 0/0 tests
5. Entrypoint detects failure → container restarts
6. **All work is lost** → cycle repeats

### Why Only 698 Tests?
The workspace appears to have a subset of tests from each volume, not all 2,126. However, the existing tests should still work if we can run them.

## Immediate Solution - Add Missing Scripts

```bash
cd /Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/myfarmstand-mobile/docker/volumes/tdd_phase_4_restore-workspace

# Add the 5 missing scripts
npm pkg set scripts.test:integration:cross-role="jest --config=jest.config.integration.cross-role.js --forceExit"
npm pkg set scripts.test:features:decision="jest --config=jest.config.decision.js --forceExit"
npm pkg set scripts.test:components:executive="jest --config=jest.config.components.executive.js --forceExit"
npm pkg set scripts.test:hooks:executive="jest --config jest.config.hooks.executive.js --verbose --forceExit"
npm pkg set scripts.test:all:executive="npm run test:hooks:executive && npm run test:components:executive && npm run test:screens:executive && npm run test:integration:cross-role && npm run test:features:decision"

# Verify
npm run | grep -E "executive|cross-role|decision"
```

## Test What We Have First

Before copying more files, let's see what pass rate we get with the 698 tests already present:

```bash
# Run each test suite individually to see pass rates
npm run test:integration:cross-role
npm run test:features:decision  
npm run test:components:executive
npm run test:hooks:executive
npm run test:screens:executive

# Then run all together
npm run test:all:executive
```

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Pass Rate is Good (>90%)
- We're done! The infrastructure is working
- Document the success
- Consider if we need all 2,126 tests or if 698 is sufficient

### If Pass Rate is Low (<90%)
1. Check for missing test utilities/mocks
2. Compare test setup files between volumes and workspace
3. Look for TypeScript compilation errors
4. Check for missing dependencies in package.json

## Why This Happened

The agent was trying to be thorough by copying test files and configs, but the critical missing piece was simply the npm scripts. The entrypoint's TEST_COMMAND expects `test:all:executive` to exist, and without it, the container keeps restarting.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the simplest fix** - Add missing scripts before copying files
2. **Test incrementally** - Run what exists before adding more
3. **Prevent restart cycles** - Ensure TEST_COMMAND scripts exist early
4. **Persistent volumes help** - Work survives container restarts, but not if scripts are missing

## Commands for Manual Fix

```bash
# From host machine
cd /Users/andrewkhoh/Documents/myfarmstand-mobile/docker/volumes/tdd_phase_4_restore-workspace

# Add all missing scripts at once
cat >> package.json << 'EOF'
# (Insert the scripts manually into the scripts section)
EOF

# Or use npm pkg set as shown above
```

## Verification

After adding scripts:
1. Container should stop restarting
2. Agent can focus on improving pass rates
3. TEST_COMMAND will succeed with actual test results
4. Progress will be preserved between cycles
