# Deep Analysis: Executive Hooks Tests - Volume vs Main

## CONFIRMED: Volume Tests DO Work, Main Tests Hang

### 1. Volume Test Execution - CONFIRMED WORKING ✅
- Command: `npm run test:hooks:executive`
- Result: Tests run and produce output (console logs, validation messages)
- Tests ARE executing and reaching test code

### 2. File-by-File Comparison - EVERYTHING IDENTICAL

#### Files Checked and Confirmed SAME:
- Jest Config: `jest.config.hooks.executive.js` - IDENTICAL (diff shows no changes)
- Test files: Same (16516 bytes for useCrossRoleAnalytics.test.tsx)
- Hook implementations: 16 files in both directories
- Setup files:
  - `src/test/setup.ts` (190 bytes) - SAME
  - `src/test/serviceSetup.ts` (3607 bytes) - SAME
- Service files: All exist in both locations
- Mock file: `src/test/mocks/supabase.simplified.mock.ts` (29186 bytes) - SAME
- Dependencies: `jest-expo: ^53.0.9` - SAME
- babel-jest: Installed in both

#### The Mystery Config Line:
Both configs have: `'^@supabase/supabase-js$': '<rootDir>/src/__mocks__/supabase.ts'`
- This file does NOT exist in EITHER location
- `src/__mocks__/` directory doesn't exist in either location
- Yet volume works, main hangs!

### 3. Only Difference Found:
**package.json test script:**
- Volume: `"jest --config jest.config.hooks.executive.js --verbose --forceExit"`
- Main: `"jest -c jest.config.hooks.executive.js --forceExit"`
- Difference: `--verbose` flag and `--config` vs `-c` (both are valid)

### 4. The REAL Mystery:

**IDENTICAL FILES + IDENTICAL CONFIG = DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR**

Volume: Tests run successfully
Main: Tests hang on startup

This suggests the issue is NOT in the files themselves but in:
1. How Jest resolves modules during startup
2. Node_modules differences
3. Some cached state or compiled files
4. The execution environment itself

### 5. Import Chain Discovery:

**The Import Chain That Causes the Hang:**
```
Test file: useCrossRoleAnalytics.test.tsx
  └─> imports: BusinessMetricsService (even though it's mocked)
      └─> imports: ../../config/supabase
          └─> imports: @supabase/supabase-js (REAL MODULE)
          └─> imports: expo-constants (REAL MODULE)
```

**Key Finding:**
- `src/config/supabase.ts` imports the REAL `@supabase/supabase-js` 
- Even though the test mocks the service, the import chain still loads the config
- The config tries to create a real Supabase client
- The jest config maps `@supabase/supabase-js` to a non-existent mock file
- This causes Jest to hang when trying to resolve the module

**Why does it work in the volume but not in main?**
- Same files, same config, same import chain
- Must be something about how the modules are resolved or cached
