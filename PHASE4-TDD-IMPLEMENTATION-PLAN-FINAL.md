# Phase 4 Executive Analytics - TDD Implementation Plan (FINAL)
## Following Phase 3B Proven Approach with Full Compliance

## 🔴 TDD Philosophy: Each Agent Owns Complete RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → AUDIT Cycle

Following the **successful Phase 3B approach** where:
1. **Each agent owns a complete layer** (not split between test writers and implementers)
2. **Each agent follows full TDD cycle** independently
3. **Agents achieve test pass rate targets** (85% minimum)
4. **Each agent commits their own work** with detailed messages
5. **Integration agent preserves all work** before testing

## 📚 MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### All Agents MUST Follow:
1. **`docs/architectural-patterns-and-best-practices.md`** - CANONICAL REFERENCE
2. **`docs/agent-prompt-communication-guidelines.md`** - Verbose progress reporting
3. **`docs/agent-prompt-structure-guidelines.md`** - 19-section prompt structure

### Integration Agent MUST Follow:
4. **`docs/integration-agent-best-practices.md`** - Work preservation protocol

## 📊 Current State Analysis (Re-Audited)

### Existing Implementation Status
| Layer | Files | Tests | Current State | Target |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Schemas** | ✅ 4/4 exist | ✅ 5 contract tests | Unknown pass rate | 85% pass |
| **Services** | ✅ 8/8 exist | ✅ 9 test files | Unknown pass rate | 85% pass |
| **Hooks** | ✅ 16/16 exist | ✅ 8 test files | Need UI enhance | 85% pass |
| **Screens** | ❌ 0/5 missing | ❌ 0 tests | Not started | 85% pass |
| **Components** | ❌ 0/20 missing | ❌ 0 tests | Not started | 85% pass |

## 📋 Communication Requirements (Per Guidelines)

### Each Agent MUST Report:

#### Console Output (Continuously):
```bash
echo "=== Starting Component: ExecutiveDashboard ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
echo "Previous state: 0/40 tests"

# During implementation...
echo "  ✓ Created ExecutiveDashboard.tsx"
echo "  ✓ Added KPI section"
echo "  ✓ Integrated TrendChart"

echo "✅ Completed: ExecutiveDashboard"
echo "Results: 38/40 tests passing (95%)"
echo "Metrics: 92% coverage, 0 TS errors"
```

#### Progress File Updates (Every Action):
```bash
log_progress() {
  echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1" >> /communication/progress/${AGENT_ID}.md
  echo "$1"  # Also to console
}

log_progress "🚀 Starting ExecutiveDashboard implementation"
log_progress "📝 Created file: ExecutiveDashboard.tsx"
log_progress "🧪 Running tests: 38/40 passing"
log_progress "✅ Component complete, committing"
```

#### Status JSON (Every Component):
```bash
echo "{
  \"agent\": \"$AGENT_ID\",
  \"cycle\": $CYCLE,
  \"component\": \"$COMPONENT\",
  \"testsPass\": $PASS,
  \"testsFail\": $FAIL,
  \"testPassRate\": $RATE,
  \"status\": \"active\",
  \"lastUpdate\": \"$(date -Iseconds)\"
}" > /communication/status/${AGENT_ID}.json
```

## 🏗️ Architectural Pattern Compliance

### Each Agent MUST Follow:

#### Zod Validation Patterns:
- Database-first validation
- Single validation pass
- Resilient item processing
- Transform schemas with explicit return types

#### React Query Patterns:
- **CRITICAL**: Use centralized query key factory
- **NEVER** create local duplicate systems
- User-isolated query keys
- Smart invalidation

#### Example Compliance Check:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Using centralized factory
import { executiveKeys } from '../../utils/queryKeyFactory';

const useBusinessMetrics = () => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: executiveKeys.metrics(), // Centralized
    // ...
  });
};

// ❌ WRONG: Local duplicate system
const localKeys = {
  metrics: ['executive', 'metrics'] // DON'T DO THIS!
};
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Agent | Layer | Total Tests | Target Pass | Min Required |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Screens | UI | 160 | 136 (85%) | 136 |
| Components | UI | 115 | 98 (85%) | 98 |
| Hooks | State | 80 | 68 (85%) | 68 |
| Integration | Cross | 75 | 64 (85%) | 64 |
| Decision | Logic | 70 | 60 (85%) | 60 |
| **TOTAL** | **All** | **500** | **426** | **85%** |

## 🚀 Execution Timeline

### Day 1-2: Parallel Agent Execution
- All 5 layer agents work simultaneously
- Each follows: AUDIT → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Each commits their own work incrementally

### Day 3: Integration & Preservation
- Integration agent preserves all uncommitted work
- Runs integration tests
- Creates final comprehensive commit

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

1. **Each agent commits their own work** - With detailed messages
2. **85% test pass rate** - Primary success metric
3. **Pattern compliance** - 100% adherence to architectural patterns
4. **No dual query key systems** - Use centralized factory only
5. **Work preservation first** - Integration agent must preserve before testing
6. **Verbose communication** - Report everything, continuously

## 📝 Agent Prompt Requirements

Each agent prompt MUST include (per guidelines):

1. **Feedback Check** - Check for improvements before starting
2. **Historical Context** - Why this version exists
3. **Critical Requirements** - Non-negotiable rules
4. **Architectural Patterns** - Required reading and examples
5. **Pre-Implementation Checklist** - Verify understanding
6. **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes
7. **Continuous Validation** - Test after every component
8. **Progress Reporting Templates** - Exact commands
9. **Mission Statement** - Clear objective
10. **Implementation Tasks** - Detailed order
11. **Test Requirements** - Coverage targets
12. **Milestone Validation** - Checkpoints
13. **Self-Improvement Protocol** - Iteration strategy
14. **Regression Prevention** - Safeguards
15. **Critical Decisions** - Do's and don'ts
16. **Communication Channels** - File paths
17. **Handoff Requirements** - What to document
18. **Common Issues** - Troubleshooting
19. **Reference Examples** - Study before starting

## ✅ Final Checklist

Before launching Phase 4:

- [ ] All agents understand they commit their own work
