 Phase 1: High Priority Security Fixes

  1. App Transport Security Configuration (CVSS 4.3)
    - Review ios/myfarmstandmobile/Info.plist:42-46
    - Evaluate if NSAllowsLocalNetworking: true is needed for
  production
    - Document business justification or disable for production
  builds

  Phase 2: Medium Priority Core Security

  2. Secure Token Storage (CVSS 5.4) - Highest Impact
    - Replace AsyncStorage with expo-secure-store in
  src/services/tokenService.ts:24,50
    - Implement iOS Keychain/Android Keystore integration
    - Add token encryption as additional security layer
  3. Type Safety Vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.6) - Broad Impact
    - Create proper TypeScript interfaces for 12+ affected files
    - Replace any types in src/services/orderService.ts:375 and
  src/hooks/useCart.ts:188
    - Enable strict TypeScript compiler options
  4. Database Schema Components (CVSS 5.1) - Operational Stability
    - Create missing tables: error_recovery_logs,
  error_recovery_results, critical_errors, no_show_logs,
  no_show_processing_logs, stock_restoration_logs
    - Remove dead code references if tables aren't needed

  Phase 3: Security Cleanup

  5. Remove Placeholder Credentials (CVSS 2.1)
    - Clean up schema_inspector.js:10-11 placeholder values
    - Implement proper environment variable handling
  6. Address Incomplete Security Implementation (CVSS 3.2)
    - Review 40+ TODO comments for security implications
    - Complete or remove unfinished security features

  Phase 4: Security Infrastructure

  7. Automated Security Testing
    - Implement dependency scanning (npm audit)
    - Add security-focused unit tests
    - Set up CI/CD security pipeline
  8. Documentation & Procedures
    - Create security architecture documentation
    - Develop incident response procedures
    - Schedule regular security audits

  Implementation Order Rationale:

  - Risk-based priority: Address highest CVSS scores first
  - Impact assessment: Token storage affects all authenticated users
  - Development efficiency: Type safety improvements prevent future
  vulnerabilities
  - Operational stability: Database fixes prevent service failures

  Each phase should be implemented, tested, and validated before
  proceeding to ensure system stability and security improvements are
   properly integrated.
