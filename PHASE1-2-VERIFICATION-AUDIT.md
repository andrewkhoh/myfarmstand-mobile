  - `rolePermissionService.ts` - Excellent ValidationMonitor integration
  - `roleNavigationService.ts` - Present with proper patterns
  - Service tests follow SimplifiedSupabaseMock correctly
  - Schema contracts implemented with compile-time enforcement

#### **Phase 2: Inventory System** 
- **✅ Inventory Services** (90% Complete)
  - `inventoryService.ts` - Excellent implementation with resilient processing
  - `stockMovementService.ts` - Present with audit trail support
  - Proper transformation schemas and ValidationMonitor integration
  - Hook infrastructure (useInventoryItems.ts) well structured

#### **Infrastructure Foundations**

- **✅ Schema Contracts** - Database-first validation, compile-time enforcement
- **✅ Hook Test Patterns** - Defensive imports and proper test setup

### **⚠️ Implementation Gaps Found**

#### **Critical Issues**
1. **🚨 Dual Query Key Systems** - Products and Auth hooks bypass centralized factory
2. **🚨 Test Infrastructure Adoption** - Only 38% adoption across codebase
3. **🚨 Missing UI Layers** - Extension screens (dashboards, management) likely incomplete

#### **Phase 1 Extension Gaps**
- ❌ Role dashboard screens
- ❌ Permission management interfaces  
- ❌ Navigation infrastructure screens
- ❌ Screen-hook integration

#### **Phase 2 Extension Gaps**  
- ❌ Inventory dashboard screens
- ❌ Real-time stock update integration
- ❌ Bulk operations interfaces
