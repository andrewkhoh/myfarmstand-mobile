## 🏗️ Pattern Compliance

### Architectural Patterns Followed ✅
- **React Query Integration**: Properly integrated with hooks
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Full type safety throughout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- **Monitoring**: ValidationMonitor integrated
- **Testing**: Standard React Native Testing Library patterns

### Test Infrastructure
- Uses established `jest.config.components.js`
- Proper mock setup in `src/test/component-setup.ts`
- React Query wrappers properly configured
- ValidationMonitor properly mocked

## ⚠️ Technical Notes
