# Payment Integration Tests

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests for the payment system, validating the complete payment flow from UI components to database operations.

## Test Structure

### PaymentFlow.test.tsx
Complete integration tests covering:
- Payment method selection flow
- Payment creation and processing
- Error handling and recovery
- Component state management
- ValidationMonitor integration

### PaymentEdgeFunctions.test.ts
Edge function integration tests covering:
- Create payment intent functionality
- Payment confirmation flow
- Stripe webhook processing
- Security validation
- Database consistency
- Error handling and rollback scenarios

### PaymentDatabase.test.ts
Database integration tests covering:
- User data isolation with RLS policies
- Payment method CRUD operations
- Atomic transaction handling
- Schema validation and constraints
- Performance and query optimization
- Connection error handling

### PaymentFlowSimple.test.tsx
Simplified component integration tests covering:
- Payment confirmation display
- Error state handling
- Payment summary calculations
- Component accessibility
- User experience flows

## Integration Test Patterns

### 1. Component Integration
Tests verify that payment components work together correctly:
- PaymentMethodSelector → PaymentForm → PaymentConfirmation
- PaymentError recovery flows
- State transitions between components

### 2. Service Integration
Tests validate service layer interactions:
- Payment service operations
- Edge function calls
- Database transactions
- Error propagation

### 3. Data Flow Integration
Tests ensure consistent data flow:
- UI input → validation → processing → storage
- Real-time updates and cache invalidation
- Error recovery and rollback

### 4. Security Integration
Tests verify security measures:
- User data isolation
- Input sanitization
- Authentication validation
- Authorization checks

## Test Environment Setup

### Mocking Strategy
- **Services**: Mocked for isolation testing
- **External APIs**: Stripe API mocked with realistic responses
- **Database**: Supabase client mocked with query simulation
- **Components**: Real components with mocked dependencies

### Test Data
- Realistic payment amounts and methods
- Valid and invalid input scenarios
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Performance stress scenarios

## Validation Patterns

### 1. Database-First Validation
All tests follow the established pattern of:
- Schema validation at database level
- Transformation schemas for data conversion
- Individual item validation with skip-on-error

### 2. User Experience Validation
Tests verify:
- Graceful error handling
- Meaningful error messages
- Recovery options for failures
- Loading states and feedback

### 3. Performance Validation
Tests ensure:
- Operations complete within time limits
- Concurrent operations handle correctly
- Database queries are optimized
- Memory usage is reasonable

## Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration"

# Run specific test files
npm test -- --testPathPattern="PaymentFlow.test.tsx"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="PaymentEdgeFunctions.test.ts"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="PaymentDatabase.test.ts"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration" --coverage
```

## Test Coverage Goals

### Component Coverage
- ✅ PaymentConfirmation: Success states, transaction display, next steps
- ✅ PaymentError: Error handling, recovery options, fallback methods
- ✅ PaymentSummary: Calculation validation, display variants
- ✅ PaymentMethodSelector: Selection flow, management actions
- ✅ PaymentForm: Input validation, submission handling

### Flow Coverage
- ✅ Happy path: Selection → Payment → Confirmation
- ✅ Error paths: Validation → Error → Recovery
- ✅ Edge cases: Network issues, server errors, invalid data
- ✅ Concurrent operations: Multiple payments, race conditions

### Integration Points
- ✅ UI → Service layer integration
- ✅ Service → Database integration
- ✅ Service → External API integration
- ✅ Real-time updates and notifications
- ✅ Error propagation and handling

## Known Testing Limitations

### React Native Testing Library Issues
- StyleSheet.flatten compatibility issues in test environment
- Some component rendering tests require workarounds
- Native module mocking complexity

### Workarounds Implemented
1. **StyleSheet Issues**: Removed StyleSheet.flatten usage in components
2. **Mock Complexity**: Simplified mock implementations for critical paths
3. **Async Operations**: Used proper async/await patterns with timeouts

## Future Improvements

### 1. End-to-End Testing
- Implement Detox or similar for full E2E flows
- Test actual Stripe integration in staging environment
- Real database operations with test data cleanup

### 2. Performance Testing
- Load testing for concurrent payment operations
- Memory leak detection during extended sessions
- Database query performance under load

### 3. Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility verification
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast and visual accessibility

### 4. Visual Regression Testing
- Component rendering consistency across platforms
- UI state transition validation
- Error state visual verification

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Updates Required
- Update test data when schema changes
- Refresh mock implementations with API changes
- Validate test coverage with new features
- Performance benchmark updates

### Monitoring Integration
- ValidationMonitor integration in tests
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics collection
- User experience analytics validation
