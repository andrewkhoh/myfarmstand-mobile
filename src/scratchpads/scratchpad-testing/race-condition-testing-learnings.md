# Race Condition Testing: Comprehensive Learnings

## Overview
This document captures the deep learnings from implementing and fixing comprehensive race condition testing across a React Query + React Native application. The journey went from broken tests (18.2% success) to complete success (100% across all hooks).

## 1. Core Principles of Race Condition Testing

### Real vs Mocked Behavior
**Key Learning**: Race condition tests MUST use real React Query behavior, not mocked behavior.

**Why**: 
- Mocked React Query doesn't exhibit the same timing, caching, and concurrency behavior as real React Query
- Race conditions are fundamentally about timing and asynchronous coordination
- Fake timers break React Query's internal scheduling and promise resolution

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Fake timers break React Query
jest.useFakeTimers();

// ✅ CORRECT - Real timers with short delays
jest.useRealTimers();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
```

### Option A Methodology: Real Timers + Short Delays
**Discovery**: The "Option A" approach became the universal solution:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers(); // Critical for React Query compatibility
  queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: { 
      queries: { retry: false }, 
      mutations: { retry: false }
    }
  });
});

// Use real short delays in service mocks
mockService.method.mockImplementation(async () => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50)); // Real delay
  return { success: true };
});
```

**Results**: This approach achieved 100% success rates across all hook types.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization in Race Condition Tests

### The Authentication Guard Problem
**Critical Issue Discovered**: Different hooks have different authentication patterns that affect race condition testing.

**Hook Patterns**:
- **useCart**: Has early return authentication guard that blocks ALL operations when not authenticated
- **useOrders**: No early return guard - operations fail gracefully through React Query error handling
- **useAuth**: Tests actual authentication behavior, needs real auth hooks

### Solution: Conditional Authentication Mocking
**Innovation**: Smart conditional mocking based on test file detection:

```typescript
const testFilePath = expect.getState().testPath || '';
const isUseAuthRaceTest = testFilePath.includes('useAuth.race.test');

if (!isUseAuthRaceTest) {
  // Mock useAuth to provide authenticated user for other tests
  jest.mock('../hooks/useAuth', () => ({
    useCurrentUser: () => ({
      data: { id: 'test-user-123', ... },
      isLoading: false,
      error: null
    })
  }));
} else {
  // Use real useAuth hooks for authentication race testing
}
```

**Result**: Allows different test suites to have appropriate authentication setup while sharing infrastructure.

## 3. Error Type Compatibility

### Strict Typing Breaks
**Problem**: TypeScript strict error typing can break race condition tests:

```typescript
// ❌ Before: Generic errors
throw new Error('Stock insufficient');

// ✅ After: Typed error objects
throw createCartError(
  'STOCK_INSUFFICIENT',
  'Stock insufficient',
  'Not enough items in stock',
  { productId: 'prod-1', requestedQuantity: 1, availableQuantity: 0 }
);
```

**Learning**: Mock errors must match the exact interface expected by error handlers, or React Query mutations may not execute.

## 4. Service Layer vs Hook Layer Mocking

### Consistent Mocking Strategy
**Best Practice**: Always mock at the service layer, never at the hook layer for race condition tests.

**Reasoning**:
- Hooks contain the race condition logic we want to test
- Services provide external dependencies that should be predictable
- React Query behavior between hooks and services is what we're testing

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// ✅ Mock services
jest.mock('../services/cartService', () => ({
  cartService: { addItem: jest.fn(), ... }
}));

// ❌ Don't mock hooks (except for conditional auth)
// jest.mock('../hooks/useCart') - NO!
```

## 5. Cross-Hook Testing Infrastructure

### Shared Setup Challenges
**Challenge**: Different hooks need different authentication setups but share the same test infrastructure.

**Solution**: Conditional setup based on test context:
- Detect which test is running
- Apply appropriate mocks conditionally
- Maintain isolation between test suites

### Infrastructure Files
**Key Files**:
- `race-condition-setup.ts`: Shared infrastructure with conditional logic
- `jest.config.hooks.race.js`: Race condition specific Jest config
- Individual test files: Hook-specific test scenarios

## 6. Test Scenario Design

### Comprehensive Coverage Areas
**Essential Test Categories**:

1. **Concurrent Operations**: Same operation called simultaneously
2. **Interleaved Operations**: Different operations overlapping in time
3. **Optimistic Updates & Rollbacks**: Testing React Query optimistic behavior
4. **State Consistency**: Multiple hook instances staying synchronized
5. **Query Invalidation**: Cache management during concurrent operations
6. **Error Handling**: Partial failures and recovery scenarios

### Example Test Pattern
```typescript
it('should handle concurrent add operations correctly', async () => {
  // Setup mocks with realistic delays
  mockService.addItem.mockImplementation(async () => {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
    return { success: true };
  });

  // Execute concurrent operations
  await act(async () => {
    await Promise.all([
      result.current.addItemAsync(product1),
      result.current.addItemAsync(product1),
      result.current.addItemAsync(product1)
    ]);
  });

  // Verify service calls and final state
  expect(mockService.addItem).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(result.current.items).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(result.current.items[0].quantity).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

## 7. Debugging Race Condition Test Failures

### Systematic Debugging Approach
1. **Check Authentication**: Is the hook receiving an authenticated user?
2. **Verify Service Calls**: Are service methods actually being called?
3. **Inspect Error Types**: Do mock errors match expected interfaces?
4. **Timing Issues**: Are delays appropriate for the operations?
5. **React Query State**: Is the query client properly configured?

### Debug Patterns
```typescript
// Add debug logging
console.log('Hook result structure:', Object.keys(result.current));
console.log('Service call count:', mockService.method.mock.calls.length);
console.log('Error state:', result.current.error);
```

## 8. Performance & Reliability

### Test Execution Times
**Observation**: Real timer tests are slower but more reliable:
- Race condition tests: 2-8 seconds per suite
- Regular tests: <1 second per suite
- Trade-off is worth it for accuracy

### Success Rate Metrics
**Target**: 85%+ success rate (due to genuine race conditions)
**Achieved**: 100% success rate with proper setup

**Success Factors**:
- Real React Query behavior
- Proper authentication setup
- Correct error type compatibility
- Appropriate timing delays

## 9. Scalability Patterns

### Reusable Infrastructure
**Pattern**: The race condition setup scales across different hook types:
- Cart operations (11/11 tests)
- Order operations (11/11 tests)
- Real-time subscriptions (13/13 tests)
- Authentication flows (12/12 tests)

### Hook Complexity Levels
**Scaling Observation**: The infrastructure works regardless of hook complexity:
- Simple hooks (basic CRUD)
- Complex hooks (real-time coordination)
- Infrastructure hooks (authentication, caching)

## 10. Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Use Fake Timers
```typescript
jest.useFakeTimers(); // Breaks React Query
```

### ❌ Don't Mock React Query
```typescript
jest.mock('@tanstack/react-query'); // Defeats the purpose
```

### ❌ Don't Use Generic Errors in Strict Typing
```typescript
throw new Error('Generic error'); // May not match interface
```

### ❌ Don't Mock Hooks Under Test
```typescript
jest.mock('../hooks/useCart'); // Testing becomes meaningless
```

### ❌ Don't Ignore Authentication Requirements
```typescript
// Hook with auth guard needs authenticated user context
```

## 11. Success Metrics & Validation

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Test Count**: 47 race condition tests across 4 hook types
- **Success Rate**: 100% (47/47 tests passing)
- **Coverage**: All core application hooks with concurrent operations
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across multiple runs

### Qualitative Validation
- Tests catch real race conditions when introduced
- Tests pass with real React Query behavior
- Tests fail appropriately when race conditions exist
- Infrastructure scales to new hooks without modification

## 12. Future Considerations

### Maintenance
- Keep authentication mocking patterns updated as hooks evolve
- Ensure new hooks follow the established testing patterns
- Monitor for React Query version compatibility

### Extension Opportunities
- Add performance benchmarking to race condition tests
- Implement stress testing with higher concurrency levels
- Add network simulation for more realistic scenarios

## Conclusion

Race condition testing in React Query applications requires:
1. **Real behavior testing** (no fake timers, no mocked React Query)
2. **Smart authentication handling** (conditional mocking based on context)
3. **Type-safe error mocking** (match exact interfaces)
4. **Comprehensive scenario coverage** (all concurrent operation patterns)
5. **Systematic debugging approach** (authentication → service calls → error types → timing)

The investment in proper race condition testing pays dividends in application reliability and confidence in concurrent user interactions.

**Final Achievement**: 100% success rate (47/47 tests) across all application hooks, validating real React Query behavior under concurrent operations.
