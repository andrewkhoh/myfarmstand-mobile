## ‚úÖ **Phase 3 Readiness Checklist**

- [x] **Phase 1 Complete**: Role-based permission infrastructure implemented
- [x] **Phase 2 Complete**: Inventory operations with role integration working
- [x] **Phase 1 & 2 Compliant**: 100% adherence to architectural patterns
- [x] **Phase 2 Tested**: All inventory tests passing and operational
- [x] **Documentation Current**: Task list aligns with established patterns
- [ ] **Team Approval**: Ready to proceed with Phase 3 implementation

---

**This detailed task list ensures 100% compliance with architectural patterns while building comprehensive marketing operations with content workflows on top of the established role-based foundation.**

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 3.1.1 - Create Database Schema (RED Phase) üöÄ

## üéØ **TDD Implementation Notes**

### **Automated Commit Strategy**
Following the established pattern from Phase 1 & 2:

1. **All tests written FIRST** (RED phase)
2. **Implementation to make tests pass** (GREEN phase)  
3. **Optimization and refactoring** (REFACTOR phase)
4. **Automatic commit when all tests pass** using commit gates

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test Hanging Prevention**
**MANDATORY for all async operations in tests:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Always use --forceExit in package.json test scripts
"test:marketing": "jest --config=jest.config.marketing.js --forceExit",
"test:hooks:marketing": "jest --config=jest.config.hooks.js --forceExit",
"test:services:marketing": "jest --config=jest.config.services.js --forceExit",

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Set test timeout and force cleanup
describe('Marketing Service Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.setTimeout(10000); // 10 second timeout
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    // Force cleanup of any pending operations
    await jest.runAllTimers();
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });
  
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Force exit cleanup
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  });
});

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Wrap all async operations with timeout
it('should handle marketing content upload', async () => {
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Test timeout')), 5000)
  );
  
  const testPromise = async () => {
    const result = await uploadContent(mockContent);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  };
  
  await Promise.race([testPromise(), timeoutPromise]);
});

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Always cleanup subscriptions and timers
it('should cleanup real-time subscriptions', async () => {
  const cleanup = setupRealtimeSubscription();
  
  try {
    // Test logic here
  } finally {
    cleanup(); // Always cleanup in finally block
  }
});
```

**üö® If tests hang:**
1. Add `--forceExit` to jest command
2. Wrap async operations in `Promise.race()` with timeout
3. Use `afterAll(() => process.exit(0))` as last resort
4. Check for unclosed database connections, timers, or subscriptions

### **Test Commands for Phase 3**
```bash
# Marketing-specific test commands (to be added to package.json)
npm run test:services:marketing     # Marketing service tests
npm run test:hooks:marketing        # Marketing hook tests  
npm run test:integration:marketing  # Marketing integration tests
npm run test:marketing              # All marketing tests

# Full test suite including Phase 1, 2, and 3
npm run test:role-based             # All role-based functionality
```

### **Commit Gate Commands**
```bash
# Schema validation
npx tsc --noEmit src/schemas/marketing/__contracts__/*.test.ts

# Service testing  
npm run test:services:marketing

# Hook testing
npm run test:hooks:marketing

# Integration testing
npm run test:integration:marketing

# Full compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit --strict
```

This Phase 3 plan builds complete marketing operations with content workflows while maintaining 100% architectural compliance and preparing the foundation for Phase 4 executive analytics.
