### **Data Source Integrations**
- **Inventory Analytics** - Stock levels, movement patterns, performance metrics
- **Marketing Analytics** - Campaign performance, content engagement, conversion rates
- **Operational Analytics** - User behavior, system performance, workflow efficiency
- **Financial Analytics** - Revenue patterns, cost analysis, profitability insights

- [ ] **Team Approval**: Ready to proceed with Phase 4 implementation

---

**This detailed task list ensures 100% compliance with architectural patterns while building comprehensive executive analytics with cross-role business intelligence on top of the established role-based foundation.**

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 4.1.1 - Create Analytics Database Schema (RED Phase) üöÄ

## üéØ **TDD Implementation Notes**

### **Automated Commit Strategy**
Following the established pattern from Phase 1, 2 & 3:

1. **All analytics tests written FIRST** (RED phase)
2. **Implementation to make tests pass** (GREEN phase)  
3. **Optimization and refactoring** (REFACTOR phase)
4. **Automatic commit when all tests pass** using commit gates

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test Hanging Prevention**
**MANDATORY for all async operations in analytics tests:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Always use --forceExit in package.json test scripts
"test:executive": "jest --config=jest.config.executive.js --forceExit",
"test:hooks:executive": "jest --config=jest.config.hooks.js --forceExit",
"test:services:executive": "jest --config=jest.config.services.js --forceExit",
"test:integration:executive": "jest --config=jest.config.integration.js --forceExit",

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Set test timeout and force cleanup for analytics
describe('Executive Analytics Service Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.setTimeout(15000); // 15 second timeout for complex analytics
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    // Force cleanup of any pending analytics operations
    await jest.runAllTimers();
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    jest.clearAllTimers();
  });
  
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Force exit cleanup for analytics
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
  });
});

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Wrap all async analytics operations with timeout
it('should generate cross-role business intelligence', async () => {
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Analytics test timeout')), 10000)
  );
  
  const analyticsPromise = async () => {
    const insights = await generateBusinessInsights(mockData);
    expect(insights.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(insights[0].confidence_score).toBeGreaterThan(0.5);
  };
  
  await Promise.race([analyticsPromise(), timeoutPromise]);
});

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Always cleanup analytics subscriptions and aggregations
it('should cleanup analytics real-time subscriptions', async () => {
  const analyticsCleanup = setupAnalyticsSubscription();
  const metricsCleanup = setupMetricsAggregation();
  
  try {
    // Complex analytics test logic here
  } finally {
    analyticsCleanup(); // Always cleanup analytics subscriptions
    metricsCleanup(); // Always cleanup metrics aggregation
  }
});

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Handle complex JSONB operations with timeout
it('should process complex correlation data', async () => {
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('JSONB processing timeout')), 8000)
  );
  
  const jsonbPromise = async () => {
    const correlations = await processCorrelationFactors(complexJsonData);
    expect(correlations).toBeDefined();
  };
  
  await Promise.race([jsonbPromise(), timeoutPromise]);
});
```

**üö® If analytics tests hang:**
1. Add `--forceExit` to all jest commands
2. Increase timeout for complex analytics operations (15s)
3. Wrap JSONB operations in `Promise.race()` with timeout
4. Use `afterAll(() => process.exit(0))` as last resort
5. Check for unclosed analytics subscriptions, aggregation timers, or database connections
6. Verify JSONB parsing operations complete properly

### **Test Commands for Phase 4**
```bash
# Executive analytics test commands (to be added to package.json)
npm run test:services:executive      # Executive analytics service tests
npm run test:hooks:executive         # Executive analytics hook tests  
npm run test:integration:executive   # Executive analytics integration tests
npm run test:executive              # All executive analytics tests

# Full test suite including Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4
npm run test:role-based             # All role-based functionality
npm run test:analytics              # All analytics functionality
```

### **Commit Gate Commands**
```bash
# Analytics schema validation
npx tsc --noEmit src/schemas/executive/__contracts__/*.test.ts

# Service testing  
npm run test:services:executive

# Hook testing
npm run test:hooks:executive

# Integration testing
npm run test:integration:executive

# Full compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit --strict
```

This Phase 4 plan builds comprehensive executive analytics with cross-role business intelligence while maintaining 100% architectural compliance and preparing for Phase 5 production readiness.
