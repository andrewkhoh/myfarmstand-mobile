## 🎯 **TDD Implementation Notes for Production**

### **Production Testing Strategy**
Phase 5 follows a different testing approach focused on system validation:

1. **Performance Testing**: Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing
2. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, audit validation
3. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end scenarios, cross-role workflows
4. **Deployment Testing**: Migration validation, rollback procedures, environment validation

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Production Test Hanging Prevention**
**MANDATORY for all async operations in production testing:**

```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED: Always use --forceExit in package.json test scripts for production
"test:production": "jest --config=jest.config.production.js --forceExit",
"test:performance": "jest --config=jest.config.performance.js --forceExit",
"test:security": "jest --config=jest.config.security.js --forceExit",
"test:deployment": "jest --config=jest.config.deployment.js --forceExit",
"test:integration:e2e": "jest --config=jest.config.e2e.js --forceExit",

// ✅ REQUIRED: Set extended timeout for production tests
describe('Production Performance Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.setTimeout(30000); // 30 second timeout for production load testing
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    // Force cleanup of any pending production operations
    await jest.runAllTimers();
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    jest.clearAllTimers();
  });
  
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Force exit cleanup for production tests
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  });
});

// ✅ REQUIRED: Wrap all production async operations with timeout
it('should handle production load with 1000+ concurrent users', async () => {
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Production load test timeout')), 25000)
  );
  
  const loadTestPromise = async () => {
    const result = await simulateProductionLoad(1000);
    expect(result.successRate).toBeGreaterThan(0.99);
    expect(result.averageResponseTime).toBeLessThan(500);
  };
  
  await Promise.race([loadTestPromise(), timeoutPromise]);
});

// ✅ REQUIRED: Cleanup database connections and monitoring
it('should cleanup production monitoring connections', async () => {
  const dbCleanup = setupProductionDbConnection();
  const metricsCleanup = setupProductionMetrics();
  const securityCleanup = setupSecurityMonitoring();
  
  try {
    // Production test logic here
  } finally {
    dbCleanup(); // Always cleanup database connections
    metricsCleanup(); // Always cleanup metrics collection
    securityCleanup(); // Always cleanup security monitoring
  }
});

// ✅ REQUIRED: Handle migration testing with timeout
it('should complete database migration within timeout', async () => {
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Migration test timeout')), 20000)
  );
  
  const migrationPromise = async () => {
    const result = await testProductionMigration();
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.dataIntegrityCheck).toBe(true);
  };
  
  await Promise.race([migrationPromise(), timeoutPromise]);
});

// ✅ REQUIRED: Handle security scanning with timeout
it('should complete security scan within timeout', async () => {
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Security scan timeout')), 15000)
  );
  
  const securityPromise = async () => {
    const scanResults = await runSecurityScan();
    expect(scanResults.criticalFindings).toBe(0);
  };
  
  await Promise.race([securityPromise(), timeoutPromise]);
});
```

**🚨 If production tests hang:**
1. Add `--forceExit` to all jest commands
2. Increase timeout for production operations (30s for load tests)
3. Wrap migration operations in `Promise.race()` with timeout
4. Use `afterAll(() => process.exit(0))` as last resort
5. Check for unclosed database connections, monitoring subscriptions, or security scans
6. Verify all production services cleanup properly
7. Monitor for memory leaks in extended test runs
