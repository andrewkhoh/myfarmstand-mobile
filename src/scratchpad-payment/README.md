## 🏗️ **Architecture Summary**

### **Core Patterns Implemented**
1. **Database-First Validation**: All business rules enforced at database level
2. **Individual Validation with Skip-on-Error**: One failure doesn't break entire flow  
3. **User Data Isolation**: RLS policies ensure complete data separation
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with recovery options
5. **ValidationMonitor Integration**: Comprehensive success/failure tracking

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React hooks for UI state
- **Backend**: Supabase with PostgreSQL and Row Level Security
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API with secure tokenization
- **Server Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library and custom integration tests

## 🚨 **Critical Implementation Notes**

### **DO NOT MODIFY These Patterns** ⚠️
These patterns exist for specific architectural reasons:

1. **Individual Validation**: Enables resilience - one bad item doesn't break the flow
2. **Database-First Validation**: Single source of truth that cannot be bypassed
3. **Skip-on-Error Processing**: Partial success is better than complete failure
4. **User Data Isolation**: Security enforced at database level automatically

### **Safe Modification Areas** ✅
1. **UI Styling**: Visual improvements without changing component architecture
2. **Error Messages**: Improving user-facing text and recovery options
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Within existing architectural patterns
4. **Additional Features**: Following established service → hook → component pattern

---

## 🔄 **Extending the System**

1. Extend `PaymentMethodType` enum in types
2. Update component rendering logic
3. Add validation rules in service layer
4. Update database schema if needed
5. Add comprehensive tests
